With one foot in Asia and one foot (a smaller foot, granted) in Europe, Turkey emerges on the tourist map as a fascinating cultural mystery, with ancient cities and towns as frequent as freckles and a history that's as long as it is complicated. Istanbul's pronounced prominence in the ancient world made it and Turkey the center of numerous great civilizations. As it passed through Byzantine and Roman hands, it sported the names Byzantine and Constantinople, eventually adopting its current name under Ottoman rule. The city is the country's tourist center, but Turkey is certainly no one-hit wonder. Mount Ararat, the ancient Biblical towns of Ephesus and Antakya (Antioch), the fairy tale formations of Cappadocia and the cultured beach towns along the Mediterranean coast make up further ammo for the Turkish arsenal of touristy delights. Excellent cuisine and a friendly, hospitable manner underscore the Turkish way of life.
Early historyThe Anatolian peninsula (also called Asia Minor), comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited regions in the world due to its location at the intersection of Asia and Europe.
Starting around 1200 BCE, the coast of Anatolia was settled by Aeolian and Ionian Greeks. The entire area was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE and later fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BCE. In 324 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine I chose Byzantium to be the new capital of the Roman Empire, renaming it New Rome (later Constantinople and Istanbul). After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it became the capital of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire).
Turks and the Ottoman EmpireIn 1243 CE, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the Mongols and the power of the empire slowly disintegrated. In its wake, one of the Turkish principalities governed by Osman I was to evolve over the next 200 years into the Ottoman Empire, expanding throughout Anatolia, the Balkans and the Levant. In 1453, the city of Constantinople fell to the Ottoman armies of Mehmed II, marking the abolition of the Byzantine Empire. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman Empire was among the world's most powerful political entities.
After nearly a century of decline, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I (1914–1918) on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated. During World War I, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed in the Armenian Genocide.
Republic eraOn 1 November 1922, the newly founded parliament formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. This was the start of the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first president and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past. According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific surname "Atatürk" (Father Turk) in 1934.
Turkey joined NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean. Following a decade of inter-communal violence on the island of Cyprus and the Greek military coup of July 1974, overthrowing President Makarios and installing Nikos Sampson as dictator, Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. Nine years later the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was established. Turkey is the only country to recognise the TRNC.
Following the end of the single-party period in 1945, the multi-party period witnessed tensions over the next decades, and the period between the 1960s and the 1980s was particularly marked by periods of political instability that resulted in a number of military coups d'etat in 1960, 1971, 1980 and a military memorandum in 1997. The liberalization of the Turkish economy that started in the 1980s changed the landscape of the country, with successive periods of high growth and crises punctuating the following decades.
Turkey shares international borders with Bulgaria, Greece, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. Turkey forms a natural bridge between the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa and is considered a transcontinental Eurasian country. Asian Turkey (made up largely of Anatolia), which includes 97% of the country, is separated from European Turkey by the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles (which together form a water link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean). European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) comprises 3% of the country. Enjoying the landscape from the tour bus_3© Vic_IVThe territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres long and 800 kilometres wide, with a roughly rectangular shape. It lies between latitudes 35° and 43° N, and longitudes 25° and 45° E. Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres, of which 755,688 square kilometres are in Asia and 23,764 square kilometres in Europe.The Turkish peninsula is encircled by four seas, each differing in characteristics and the amount of salinity: Mediterranean Sea to the south, Agean Sea to the west, the Sea of Marmara between the Asia and European land masses, and the Black Sea to the north. The Asian part of the country, Anatolia, consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the Köroğlu and Pontic mountain ranges to the north and the Taurus Mountains to the south. Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of rivers such as the Euphrates, Tigris and Aras, and Lake Van, the largest lake in the country. The highest mountain peak in the country is the biblical Mount Ararat at 5,165 metres above sea level.
Turkey consists of 7 administrative regions, divided into 81 provinces and 923 districts! The 7 administrative regions and its provinces are: MarmaraEdirne, Kirklareli, Istanbul, Tekirdag, Çanakkale, Balikesir, Bursa, Yalova, Kocaeli, Sakarya and BilecikAegean TurkeyIzmir, Manisa, Kütahya, Usak, Afyonkarahisar, Aydin, Denizli and MuglaMediterranean TurkeyBurdur, Isparta, Antalya, Mersin, Adana, Hatay, Osmaniye and KahramanmarasBlack Sea TurkeyBolu, Düzce, Zonguldak, Bartin, Karabük, Kastamonu, Sinop, Samsun, Çorum, Amasya, Tokat, Ordu, Giresun, Trabzon, Gümüshane, Bayburt, Rize and ArtvinCentral AnatoliaEskisehir, Çankiri, Ankara, Kirikkale, Yozgat, Sivas, Kirsehir, Kayseri, Nevsehir, Aksaray, Nigde, Karaman and KonyaEastern AnatoliaMalatya, Erzincan, Tunceli, Elazig, Bingöl, Erzurum, Bitlis, Mus, Hakkari, Van, Agri, Igdir, Kars and ArdahanSoutheastern AnatoliaKilis, Gaziantep, Adiyaman, Sanliurfa, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Batman, Siirt and Sirnak
Most provinces have the same name as their capital, with just a few exceptions to this rule, being Hatay (capital Antakya), Kocaeli (capital Izmit) and Sakarya (Adapazari).
Cappadocia is one of the most spectacular places to visit when travelling around Turkey. It landscapes and cultural landscapes make this a place not to miss and therefore the Göreme National Park and Rock Sites are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Göreme Valley and its surroundings are in a dramatic landscape, sculpted by erosion and rock-hewn sanctuaries are a must see. The area further has dwellings and underground towns which are in fact the remains of a traditional human habitat dating back to the 4th century.
A hot air balloon flight at sunrise or sunset is an activity you can do here as well and is an experience you will never forget. Accommodation is high quality and very reasonably priced. There are a good range of guesthouses and luxury hotels to cater for all tastes.
Turkey is full of ancient ruins and a visit to one or several of those is a step back in time. A very nice one is located near the town of Bergama in the west of the country and is called Pergamon. Bergama boasts the Akropol, the Temple of Serapis, the Asklepion, The Allianoi and the Red Basilica. Mosques and museums keep you busy for days. Troy is not really far from here as well, and is probably one of the most famous ones in the world and on the UNESCO World Heritage List for apparent reasons. Who doesn't know the Trojan horse? Ephesus is yet another ancient ruin and the list is long. Hours away by plane on the other side of the country is Ani, a ruined and uninhabited medieval city in the eastern Turkish province of Kars close to the border with Armenia. It was once the capital of a medieval Armenian kingdom that covered much of present day Armenia and eastern Turkey.
If you're into truly ancient history, then there are few more interesting places to visit in the world than Göbekli Tepe, by a long shot the oldest man-made place of worship featuring intricately carved megaliths and dating right back to 10,000 BC. The site is a good 6,000 years older than Stonehenge but was only fairly recently discovered.
Probably the best way to get up close and personal with ancient ruins in Turkey is by walking some or all of the Lycian way - Turkey's first long distance walking trail. This 500-kilometre walk traverses many of the coastal settlements from Antalya to Oludeniz and can be split up into smaller easier to manage walks.
Unfortunately, much of the western and southern coastline of Turkey is full with luxurious hotels catering mainly to package tourist from Europe. Luckily, if you just travel away from main places like Marmaris, Kusadasi or Alanya, there are friendly and small villages as well as almost deserted beaches. Sailing along the Turkish coast is a popular way of travelling around as well. The Lycean Way, Turkeys famous and the worlds longest marked walking trail, follows a lot of the coast. If you have the time, walking along the coast is a perfect way of seeing it up close and personal. And for people wanting something totally different, there is always the northern Black Sea coastline, which is less crowded, at least with western tourists, and rather spectactular and more green in places as well.
Pamukkale literally means "cotton castle" in Turkish and is located in Denizli Province of Turkey. The formation of the so-called castle took place after several earthquake eruptions and the emergence of hot springs, especially the ones rich with mineral. These springs have been used as spa since second century BC. The ancient city of Hierapolis is also located on the same hill. Hierapolis together with Pamukkale is recognized as a World Heritage Site.
Safranbolu in Central Anatolia was an important caravan station on the main east-west trade route from the 13th century until railways were built in the early 20th century. The Old Mosque, Old Bath and Süleyman Pasha Medrese were built in 1322 and are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Mount Ararat is the highest mountain of Turkey and is located in the far east of the country, not far from the border of Armenia, which claims that the mountain should actually be on Armenian grounds. This dormant volcano has a snow-capped cone year-round, so you really need crampons, an axe and some climbing experience to make it to the top. The mountain has long been subject in debates but since 1923 with the Treaty of Kars, the mountain is on Turkish grounds, much to the dislike of Armenia. Ararat has been revered by the Armenians since ancient times as their spiritual home. Today, it is the national symbol of Armenia and on clear days the views from the capital Yerevan are tremendous. An even better view is possible from the monastery Khor Virap, a little bit more south just across the border from Turkey.
The start of spring sees Istanbul come alive with colour as over 10 million tulips of over 100 different varieties are planted throughout the city. The festival organised by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and a photographer and flower lover's delight. Best place to view the tulip are Emirgan Park and Gulhane Park. [/listing]
The Ankara Film Festival is a wonderful event held in Turkey’s capital. Each year during the month of March, travelers, film-buffs, directors, and acclaimed actors from across the globe come to Ankara for screenings at venues around the city.
The largest event in Turkey’s largest city, the Istanbul Music festival lasts about two months, filling June and July with a range of interesting concerts and performances. Tourists will be able to enjoy classical and opera performances, theatrical shows, and traditional tunes from regions around the country.
One of the most renowned musical events in Turkey’s Gumusluk area, the bulk of the festival begins on July 5, although classical performances are held several times in July, August and September. Symphony orchestras offer a relaxing way to rejuvenate after a long day of sightseeing.
First established in 1986, the Istanbul Jazz Festival is one of the most popular musical events in the nation. It is held every July, attracting thousands of revelers from all over the country. Even though Jazz is the focus, there are plenty of other genres to enjoy.
This Roman festival known as Kakava is celebrated by Romani people throughout the Middle East and Turkey. The Edirne Festival is enjoyed on May 5-6 and sees more than 5,000 people attend.
The beautiful and ancient city of Aspendos is home to a wonderful Roman theater, where the Aspendos International Opera Festival is held each year. More than 10,000 spectators flock to the experience the wonder of live drama in June.
Often regarded as the most famous festival in Turkey, the Kadirga Festival is a stupendous event that showcases some of the most fascinating aspects of Turkish culture. Set a dozen miles from the heart of Tonya township upon the treeless plateaus of the hinterland, the event is celebrated by visitors and the locals of Tonya, Torul, Macka, Gorele, and Eynesil every year in July.
The oldest trade show and exhibition in Turkey is the exciting Izmir Fair held at the large show ground of Kulturepark during the early days of September. There are several other fairs during the event, including a popular musical festival.
The climate in Turkey has a vast diversity depending on the diverse topography and latitude.
Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas enjoy the typical Mediterranean climate. There is hardly a drop of rain during the sunny and hot summer (May to October). Winters are mild and rainy in these regions, and it very rarely snows at coastal areas, with the exception of mountainous areas higher than 2000 metres of these regions, which are very snowy and are frequently not passable. The water temperature in the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas is warm during the long summer season (May to October) which constitutes the swimming season and fluctuates between 23° and 28 °C from north to south.
The region around the Sea of Marmara, including Istanbul, has a transitional climate between an oceanic climate and a semi-Mediterranean climate, but it does rain, albeit not a lot, during the very warm summer (as showers which tend to last for 15-30 minutes). Its winters are colder than those of the western and southern coasts. Snow is common at coastal areas, although it doesn't stay on the ground for long and is limited to only a few days every winter. The water temperature in the Sea of Marmara is also colder than the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, with the water temperature reaching only between 20° and 24 °C during the summer (June, July and August) and the swimming season is restricted to those summer months.
The Black Sea region has an oceanic climate (thanks to the protective shield effect of Caucasus mountains) with the greatest amount of precipitation and is the only region of Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year. The eastern part of that coast averages 2,500mm annually which is the highest precipitation in the country. Summers are warm and humid while the winters are cool and damp. Snow is common at coastal areas, although it doesn’t stay on the ground for long and is limited to only a few days every winter, though mountains are very snowy as it is expected to be and are frequently not passable, there are glaciers around the year in the highest zones. The water temperature along the Turkish Black Sea coast varies between 10° and 20 °C through the year.
Most of the coastal areas have a high level of relative humidity during most of the year which makes hot weather feel hotter and cold weather feel colder than it actually is.
Interior areas like Ankara, generally have hot summers (though the nights are cool enough to make someone who is wearing only a thin t-shirt uncomfortable outdoors) and cold and snowy winters. The more easterly the location is, the colder the winters are and the heavier the snow is. The northeastern part (around Erzurum and Kars) is the only inland area which has cool and rainy summers.
The southeastern region near the Syrian border has a desert-like climate, temperature is frequently above 40 °C during summers with no rain. Snowfall is occasional in winter.
Atatürk International AirportIstanbul Atatürk International Airport (IATA: IST, ICAO: LTBA), is a major international airport in Turkey. It is located in Yeşilköy, on the European side of Istanbul, 24 kilometres (15 miles) west of the city centre.
Flag carrier Turkish Airlines is based in IST and has a very extensive network of flights throughout all of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, parts of Africa and a few flights to North America. Dozens of airlines serve the same destinations, among which are KLM, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Air France, Malaysia Airlines, Delta Airlines and Aeroflot.
Sabiha Gökçen International AirportSabiha Gökçen International Airport (IATA: SAW, ICAO: LTFJ), located 35 kilometres (22 miles) southeast of Istanbul, is on the Asian side of the city. The newly expanded SAW has a growing number of flights and is mainly catering to charter flights from Europe and low-cost carriers.
Pegasus Airlines and Turkish Airlines have the most connections from this airport. Other carriers include Air Arabia (Sharjah), Corendon Airlines (Amsterdam) and easyJet (London).
Other airportsThe Esenboğa International Airport (ESB) near the capital Ankara has some international flights as well, mainly from places like London, Frankfurt and Vienna and a few destinations in Asia, like Kabul. Turkish Airlines has the most flights.
Lots of charter airlines fly to other airports in the west and south along the Turkish Coast and cater almost exclusively to package tourists from the west of Europe, although some cheap flights might be a good alternative for the more adventurous travellers to start their trips in places like Bodrum, Dalaman, Antalya or Alanya. Especially Antalya Airport and Dalaman Airport have numerous airlines flying there and Antalya Airport is in fact the second busiest airport in the country. Also, Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport is one of the busier airports in the region.
The 'Trans-Asia Express' travels on a weekly schedule between the gateway to Asia, Istanbul, and the capital of Iran, Tehran. Trains leave Istanbul on Wednesday at around 11:00pm and arrives in Tehran about 70 hours later. In the opposite direction, trains leave Tehran on Thursday at around 6:30pm and take about the same time. The train ride is divided into two parts, one from Istanbul to Lake Van and one from Lake Van to Tehran and only one carriage actually is moved over the lake to make the entire journey.
The 'Filia Express' leaves the Sirkeci station(on European part of Istanbul) at 9pm and arrives next day at 09:33am in the Greek town of Thessaloniki. There is an onward connection from here to Athens by an Inter city express train which leaves Thessaloniki at 10:21am and arrives in Athens at 3:16pm the same day. In the opposite direction the train leaves Athens at 1:23pm and arrives next day in Istanbul at 08:04am with a changes of trains at Thessaloniki.
The 'Balkan Express' leaves the Sirkeci station(on European part of Istanbul) at 10:00pm and arrives next day at 11:40am in Sofia. In the opposite direction the train leaves Sofia at 7:30pm and arrives next day in Istanbul at 08:00am. The same train used to operate till Belgrade in Serbia, but currently due to some engineering work, the service is limited till Sofia.
Every Sunday at around 9:00am, a sleeper train leaves Haydarpasa station in Istanbul for the Syrian city of Aleppo, arriving on Mondays around 2:00pm. In the opposite direction the train leaves Aleppo station on Tuesday around 11:00am, taking over 30 hours to reach Istanbul early evening on Wednesday.
Turkey shares borders with Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Armenia. Except to the last country, all borders are open but the border with Iraq is probably best avoided when you are travelling by a rental car or your own car (crossing is still possible and relative safe though by bus/taxi/foot).
In Turkey, driving is on the right side of the road and many roads and signs (Turkey uses the Latin alphabet, not Arabic) are of good quality. The skills of the drivers certainly are not and you really need a few days to get used to it.
National Express and Eurolines have connections between Turkey and other parts of Europe. There are numerous companies offering direct bus travel from places in Europe, including cities further away like Frankfurt and Vienna. Other countries served are Bulgaria, Greece, Syria, Iran and Georgia.
Turkey has several connections with neighbouring countries and even Italy by boat. To the latter, Marmara Lines has summer ferries travelling between Ancona and Çeşme and Brindisi and Çeşme as well. MedEuropean Seaways operates the latter route as well.
The Fergün Shipping Company has ferries on the same two routes between Turkey and Italy but has much more connections as well. These include ferries in summer between Mesmin and Latakia in Syria and between Sinop and Yalta in Ukraine.
They also have ferries travelling between the southern coast of Turkey and the Turkish part of Cyprus. Connections include Alanya-Girne, Tasucu-Girne and Gazimagusa-Mersin.
Finally to Greece, the same company has ferries to Samos, Rhodes, Kos and Chios from Cesme, Kusadasi, Marmaris, Bodrum and Yalikavak on the west and southwest coast of Turkey.
A few other private companies have connections beetween Lesbos and Ayvalik and between Rhodos and Fethiye.
Ukrferry has more connections to Ukraine, between both Istanbul and Odessa and Derince and Ilyichevsk.
The Turkish airport network is expanding regarding flights and companies. The most important airports are in Istanbul, Ankara, Trabzon, Erzurum, Diyarbakir, Dalaman and Izmir, with several others along the coast and interior having a growing number of flights as well.
Airlines include Turkish Airlines, Corendon Airlines, Atlas Jet, Onur Air and Sun Express.
Turkish Railways has several rail connections which are definitely worth it. The scenery, especially when travelling further to the central and eastern parts, are fantastic. They are, however, slower than buses and services are infrequent compared to buses as well. Comfort is a huge plus on the other hand and the overnight trains have comfortable berths and basic meals.
Turkish Railways has a 30-day railpass, which offers unlimited use of all lines.
Roads in Turkey are well maintained and renting a car (possible with driver as well) is possible with many international and local companies having agencies at airports and cities. You need an international driver's licence and international insurance and a carnet de passage if you want to travel further to the Middle East. You are allowed to bring your own car for a maximum period of six months.
Varan and Ulusoy are among the best bus companies in the country, both offering an extensive networks of frequent, comfortable and reliable buses. Most have toilets on board and you even get drinks and snacks. There are however numerous other companies and for shorter local connections, the minibuses (dolmus) are frequent and reliable options as well.
A frequent car ferry crosses the Dardenelles at Gallipoli, from Çanakkale to Eceabat and Gelibolu to Lapseki. Istanbul Fast Ferries has frequent services between a number of places in the Istanbul region. And Denis Cruise and Ferry Lines plies the Istanbul to Izmir route frequently. The Fergün Shipping Company has services between Istanbul and Bodrum, Bandirma and Yalova as well as between Bodrum and Datca and Marmaris, and Canakkale to Eceabat vv.

The official currency in Turkey is Turkish Lira (turk lirasi). One lira is divided into 100 kurush. The symbol is TL.
New Turkish Lira banknotes are very similar to Euro so be very careful when you are using and exchanging money in Turkey.
Work as an English teacher is reasonably easy to stumble upon. Contracts will sometimes include accommodations, airfare, and health-care.You need to have a work permit to work in Turkey. The control over illegal workers have grown stricter in the past five years with the consequence of deportation, so take the work permit issue seriously.
There are many language schools where you can study Turkish in most of the big cities. Ankara University affiliated Tömer is one of the most popular language schools in Turkey and has branches in many big cities, including Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir among others.Many Turkish universities (both public and private) are participating in pan-European student exchange programs (Socrates, Erasmus, and the like). Some also have agreements with non-European universities, too. Check with your own university and the one that you intend to study in Turkey.
The majority of Turkey's inhabitants speak Turkish. Turkish language is the most commonly spoken of the Turkic languages. The script was changed from Arabic to Latin by Ataturk after the formation of the republic.
Kurdish is also a widely spoken language in Turkey. There are debates over the number of speakers. Kurdish speakers mostly live in eastern and southeastern parts of the country as well as Istanbul where there is a high number of Kurdish immigrants. A Kurdish speaker can get by in Kurdish settlements in these areas most of the time, depending on the dialect. Kurmanji is the most widely spoken dialect. The script varies from country to country. In Turkey, Kurds use the Latin alphabet.
There are many other languages spoken by minorities such as Arabic, Armenian, and Greek.
Even though English language education is part of the mandatory Turkish education system the number of English speakers is relatively low. One may find it easy to get by in tourist sights but it may be frustrating to communicate when travelling outside of sight-seeing areas. Knowing German can help, as it is the second most important foreign language in Turkey aside from English. Quite a number of Turks have lived in Germany for a few years and if you don't find somebody who speaks English you might find somebody who speaks German.
If any public announcement is bilingual the second language would be English. Usually traffic signs pointing to museums, libraries, hospitals and sight seeing places are bilingual.
There are fast food restaurants almost in every city that serves kebabs made off chicken, beef and lamb. Every region has their unique kebabs. Make sure to try local kebab of each region. Tantuni, Iskender, Tas Kebabi are among these regional kebabs.
Kokorec, a delicacy of Turkish cuisine, is grilled spicy intestines. In big cities it is sold widely and in smaller cities it is usually sold late at nights. Southern and southeastern regions are famous for offal dishes. These dishes are made up of intestines, stomach, kidneys, livers, lungs, heart, brain.
Coastal areas have a lot of sea food. Fish and shell fish is easily available throughout Turkey. The Black sea region is particularly rich in fresh Sardine dishes.
Turkey is renowned worldwide for its range of desserts. Desserts may be broadly classified into three groups: Syrupy pastries, Milk puddings and fruit desserts. Baklava is the most famous of all the desserts and consists of fifteen layers, eights layers of pastry and seven layers of pistachio. The filling may vary regionally with the substitution of hazelnuts or walnuts. Some of the other desserts worth mentioning are Halvah, Lokum(Turkish Delight), Asure and Kadaif.
Turkey has a wide range of accommodation options, from pitching your tent on a simple camping to luxurious 5-star hotels, mainly in the biggest cities and along the coastline. In between, there are simple and midrange hotels, some hostels (mainly in Istanbul) and many guesthouses, which offer cheap, safe and clean accommodation, mostly with breakfast as well.
National drink of Turkey is raki, similar to Greek ouzo and Arabic arak.
There are no vaccinations legally required to travel to Turkey. It's a good thing to get your vaccinations in order before travelling to Turkey. The general vaccination against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Polio (DTP) is recommended. Also a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended and vaccination against hepatitis B, typhoid and rabies are also sometimes recommended for stays longer than 3 months.
Malaria only occurs in a few small and remote areas in the southeast (Kurdistan) of the country, and usually only in the summermonths. Taking pills is not necessary, just use repellant and sleep under a net as the mosquitos are most active when it's dark.
Finally, other possible health issues include diarrhea and other general travellers' diseases like motion sickness. Watch what you eat and drink and in case you get it, drink plenty of fluids (to prevent dehydration) and bring ORS.
Pharmacies or eczanes (as they are know locally) are available throughout the cities of Turkey and offer affordable medication which often can be bought over the counter without prescriptions (e.g. antibiotics).
In general, Turkey is a very safe and hospitable country with extremely friendly people, even in big cities like Istanbul. But especially in the central regions further north and east you will discover the true meaning of friendliness. Most small crime occurs at big markets and transport hubs in big cities and along the popular Mediterranean coastline resort areas.
Although not necessarily dangerous, as a solo (especially blonde!) female traveller, you can expect some extra attention. Try not to walk alone at night or in deserted areas and if possible, travel with a companion.
Internet cafes can be found everywhere except small rural villages. The cost of an hour use of internet ranges from 1 YTL to 1.5 YTL. Wireless internet is becoming popular in some cafes in big cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, and at airpots. But in many other places it's still not available, or sometimes at a very high cost.
Turkey's international country code is 90. Dial 112 for an ambulance anywhere, from any telephone, without a charge. In case of a fire, dial 110; for police, call 155. However, in rural areas there is not a police coverage, so dial 156 for gendarme, a military unit for rural security. All these numbers are free of charge and can be called from a telephone booth without inserting a calling card, or any phone including cell phones.
There are telephone booths owned by Turk Telekom in major parts of cities. public phones now operate with chip telekom cards which are available in 30, 60 or 120 units and can be obtained at post offices, newspaper and tobacco kiosks.It is estimated that approximately 98% of the population of Turkey lives within the coverage areas of Turkey’s three cell phone line providers. Line providers from most countries have roaming agreements with one or more of these companies. Pre-paid mobile phone SIM cards can be purchased for approximately TRY20-50. These can be purchased at the airport on arrival or from the many outlets in Istanbul and other large cities. Providers include Vodaphone.
PTT is the national post service in Turkey. Services are generally moderately fast but quite reliable. There is an extended price list on the PTT website, where you can see the costs of sending items within Turkey, countries in Europe and further afield. For sending packages one might also use international companies such as DHL and UPS and local companies such as Yurtici Kargo. Post offices bear the distinctive yellow PTT sign and are generally open between 9:00am to 12:00 noon and 1:30pm to 5:00pm from Monday to Friday. Some might keep longer hours or be open during the weekend as well, but this mainly applies to the larger ones or those in central places and tourist areas.
as well as Peter (5%), arif_kool (2%), Namaste01 (1%), incirus (1%), Where (1%), adamandmeg (1%), Lavafalls (<1%), jakewuensch (<1%), dr.pepper (<1%), t_maia (<1%), oozcelik (<1%)
One of my favourite countries for travelling, I spent 6 months studying Turkish in Istanbul, and have visited several times since then, touring the Black Sea coast, Central and SE Anatolia, as well as places around Istanbul.
I am an Istanbul dweller, a friendly native who knows his way around his hometown. I like meeting people, I would be happy to provide pointers as to where to go and what to do, where to eat and what is way too an "tourist trap", dispel myths.. and so forth.  I am not a tourist guide, but like people, have quite flexible working hours and check my email often.  Ask away, and I will do my best.
offer loads of advice about the places to go to and things to do.

Australia is one of the most popular destinations on the planet for backpackers and luxury travellers alike. World-renowned landmarks like Sydney's Opera House and Harbour Bridge, Uluru, the Great Barrier Reef, Great Ocean Road and some of the most unique wildlife on the planet have helped Australia become a must see destination on any traveller's list.
Australia is truly like nowhere else on the planet. It possesses approximately 36,000 kilometres (22,000 miles) of beautiful coastline, 15 World Heritage Listed sites and over 3,000 national reserves. A brilliant mix of natural wonders, fantastic food and wine, culture, history, cosmopolitan cities and laid-back friendly locals, it is a peaceful backdrop to any holiday, encouraging visitors to return time and time again for the unique collection of adventures on offer.
The first people to discover Australia did so approximately 40,000 years before Europeans set foot on the continent. Recently unearthed evidence suggests, somewhat controversially, that the first European to visit Australia was Portuguese explorer Christopher de Mendonca, who led a flotilla of four ships into Botany Bay in 1522 - almost 250 years before Britain's Captain James Cook. [2]
Australian Aboriginals flourished in lush coastal regions as hunter/gatherers. The British colonisation of Australia, which began in New South Wales in 1788, had a disastrous effect on the Aboriginal people, as they fell prey to infectious diseases carried by the new settlers and were gradually displaced from their traditional homeland.
Meanwhile European settlement spread to other parts of Australia. Brisbane was founded in 1825. Western Australia was founded in 1829. The city of Perth was founded that year. In 1834 a man named John Batman decided the site of Melbourne was a good place to found a settlement. In 1835 he made a treaty with the Aborigines in which he gave them trade goods for land. However the treaty was not recognised by the British government, which disregarded it. Nevertheless the city of Melbourne was laid out on the land in a grid pattern. In 1836 another colony was founded at Port Adelaide, which grew into South Australia. The city of Adelaide was planned by Colonel William Light (1786-1839) the first Surveyor General of Australia. After 1815 thousands of new settlers arrived in Australia every year fleeing poverty in Britain. By 1840 the white population of Australia was about 160,000. By 1851 it was about 430,000. Meanwhile explorers such as Charles Sturt 1795-1869 and Thomas Mitchell 1792-1855 explored the interior of Australia. In 1851 Victoria was made a separate state from New South Wales. Queensland grew from a settlement at Moreton Bay, which was founded in 1824. Queensland became independent in 1859.
Australia did not become a federated nation until 1901 when all the colonies voted for amalgamation, and at that point the colonies became states. Even then Australia remained a part of the British Empire, with the British Monarch as its Head of State and a population consisting primarily of Anglo-Saxons. In 1931 the Statute of Westminster Act was passed into law in London, and eventually ratified in Canberra in 1942 (backdated to 1939) - this Act gave Australia its independence as a nation.
From 1931 the British Empire no longer existed, instead an association of independent countries has formed over time since then and is known as the Commonwealth of Nations. The British Monarch at this time also continued to be the Australian Head of State - hence in Australia, the official title of the current head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia which is a legally separate and distinct role to her position as the Queen of Britain.
Throughout the 20th century, Australia maintained its ties with the UK, even though the post-WWII years saw increased immigration from other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. In 1999, Australians voted in a referendum to decide whether to become a republic, but the proposal was rejected by 55% of voters, possibly more so because of a rejection of the model offered than by an overwhelming desire to retain the Queen as Head of State.
Australia is the sixth largest country in the world, covering a land area of over 7,680,000 km². It is sandwiched by the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. As it is an island, it has no neighbouring countries, but it is near Papua New Guinea and Indonesia (north) and New Zealand (east).
Australia comprises six states and two territories: New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and the Australian Antarctic territory.
Australia is geographically diverse, partly owing to its immense size. The centre of the continent is desert, known to Australians as the Outback. The vast majority of the population is concentrated around the eastern and south-eastern coasts.
The north eastern coastline hosts the largest coral reef structure in the world, the Great Barrier Reef, consisting of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands that stretch for 2,600 kilometres and cover an area of approximately 344,400 km².
The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, composed of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands that stretch for 2,600 kilometres (1,616 miles) and cover an area of approximately 344,400 km² (132,974 square miles). The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland in northeast Australia.
Tasmania is the most significant island of Australia and a state in its own right. Others include:
There are quite a few uninhabited islands including the Coral Sea Islands, Houtman Abrolhos, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the remote Antarctic territories of Heard Island and McDonald Islands and Macquarie Island.
It may not be the official capital, but Sydney is the focal point of Australian business and tourism. The iconic Sydney Opera House is one of Australia's best-recognised national symbols. Kangaroos and koalas can be seen at Sydney's prestigious Taronga Zoo, and no visit to Australia would be complete without a trip to the famous Bondi Beach or without riding the famous Manly Ferry. But a trip to Sydney is not just about seeing the obvious sights: it's also about taking in a diverse multicultural society, enjoying fine wine and food and launching into the surrounding Australian countryside.
Melbourne may not get the hordes of tourists that Sydney does, but rest assured that Australia's 2nd largest city packs as powerful a punch. Melburnians are a fashionable, trendy lot, provided you ignore the beer-guzzling sports fans cheering for their favourite AFL team at the MCG, Australia's largest sports stadium. Melbourne is a place where heading down dark alleyways could lead you to some of the city's most unique and interesting bars.
Adelaide, referred to by many Australians as the 'city of churches' is the capital of South Australia and with a little over 1.1 million inhabitants, home to nearly 70% of all people living in the state and Australia's fifth largest city. With a nickname originating from the settlement of the area and the desire to create a dignified city, it is a surprise to many that today pubs and nightclubs outnumber the churches. Adelaide is located on the coast, the southern side of South Australia, and the area surrounding Adelaide is popular for surfing. The city is well laid out, with plenty of parks, gardens, wide boulevards and large public squares to give it a spacious and overall relaxing feel. Adelaide is known for its many festivals, arts and sports. With it's location plump in the center of the wine regions of McLaren Vale, the Barossa Valley and Clare Valley, Adelaide is also an opportune location from which to undertake daytrips to the many vineyards in the surrounding areas.
Brisbane is a clean friendly, sunny and pleasant city in which to spend a few days before heading off to explore Queensland, or in which to recuperate after exploring. Brisbane is a rapidly growing modern metropolis which has given it greater stature in recent years, however it still retains the friendliness and relaxed attitude it has always been known for. Known locally as Brissie or Brisvegas, its the country's third largest city. For a city with less two million inhabitants, it certainly has a lot to offer; world class art galleries, massive music venues and a bustling restaurant scene.
Canberra is the capital city of Australia and is located in the Australian Capital Territory to the southwest of Sydney. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: Canberra. It was constructed in the early 1900's following a design by architect Walter Burley Griffin. The highly organised layout is evidence of the planning that went into this city. As a result of being the nation's capital, Canberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery currently housed at Old Parliament House, the National Library of Australia, the National Archives of Australia, and the National Museum of Australia.
Darwin is the capital of the Northern Territory and Australia's smallest state capital, home to just over 100,000 people. It is a good base to explore the surrounding natural attractions including the UNESCO World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park. Its blend of Caucasian, Asian and Aboriginal cultures make it an interesting place to spend some time.  The city has been virtually wiped out twice in its short history; once due to air raids during WWII and again when Cyclone Tracy hit in the 1970's. As a result, the city has a distinctly modern (albeit small scale) feel to it.
Hobart, the capital of Tasmania and Australia's smallest state capital is a charming harbour city. It is Australia's second oldest city, founded in 1803 as a penal colony. Hobart lies at the foot of Mount Wellington and on the banks of the Derwent River. The waterfront areas Macquarie Wharf, Constitution Dock, Salamanca Place and Battery Point are just gorgeous with their Georgian buildings and the looming presence of Mount Wellington in the background. The locals are very relaxed, super friendly and have none of the snobbery of Sydney and Melbourne inhabitants.
Perth is the capital of the Australian state of Western Australia. A population of 1.5 million makes Perth the largest city in Western Australia and home to three-quarters of the state's residents. The city is also the fourth most populous urban area in Australia, and with a growth rate of 2% is currently the fastest growing major city in Australia. It's also generally considered as the biggest city in the world which is furthest away from any other big city. The nearest in fact would be Adelaide.
Cairns is located in the northeast of Australia, along the northern coastline of Queensland. Although the city itself might not have that much to offer, it's surroundings are stunning. It's the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the Tropical Rainforests of the north, including beautiful Cape Tribulation. Also, Port Douglas and Kuranda are just a short drive away.
Australia has an enormous coastline with fantastic beaches. Although some are not recommended because of a number of reasons (undertow, sharks, salties), there are numerous beaches which are fantastic for just seeing and to be seen, swimming, surfing and snorkelling. Bondi Beach in Sydney is probably one of the best known and busiest beaches in the country. More to the north, the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast (including Surfers Paradise) are popular among people loving beaches and all sorts of aquatic activities and of course partying. Queensland has the finest beaches and this is also one of a few places where the rainforest meets the beaches and reef and Cape Tribulation and surroundings. Western Australia has some great beaches around Broome, Coral Bay, Shark Bay and Monkey Mia with supreme activities like dolphin feeding and snorkelling with whale sharks and manta rays.
The Blue Mountains area in New South Wales in Australia has been listed on the UNESCO World Heritage list for the unique eucalypt varieties that grace its 1 million hectares. The numerous national parks in the region offer much more than botanic interest though. The sightseeing potential in the Blue Mountains, symbolised by sites like the Three Sisters and the Jenolan Caves, succeeds in annually attracting thousands of visitors.
Cape Tribulation is the furthest point north that most people visiting Queensland reach. It is part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland, the rainforest here is thick, ancient and teems with wildlife. There is a range of activities here, including guided rainforest walks which are particularly recommended. Be aware that it is possible to get stuck in Cape Tribulation in summer if the rain is particularly heavy, as the creeks rise up above the road. Be sure to give yourself a couple of days room to catch flights etc.
Away from Australia's coastal regions, large parts of the country are desert. Together they cover 1,371,000 km² and occupy nearly a fifth of the continent. Far from being something to avoid, the deserts are one of the greatest natural attractions of the country. The five largest Australian deserts are the Great Victoria Desert, Tanami Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Simpson Desert and the Gibson Desert. Smaller ones include the Little Sandy Desert, the Sturt's Stony Desert, the Strzelecki Desert and the Tirari Desert. The latter three are located in the border area of South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, while the others are more to the central and central western parts of the country, which forms a much larger continuous area of desert landscapes. More information can be found in the Australian Deserts article.
The Explorer Highway is just one of many great road trips in Australia. The route follows the trail of legendary explorer John McDouall Stuart, the first European to cross Australia from south to north. Although the original route is not exactly the same anymore, parts of it still are. The route starts in Adelaide, or actually in Port Augusta, north of the city. From there you cross the deserts of South Australia and the Northern Territory before ending in tropical Darwin. Along the way are many points of interest, including Coober Pedy, Alice Springs and Katherine. But don't forget to take bypasses to Uluru (Ayers Rock) for example, or to Kakadu National Park up in the north of the country. To enjoy this trip, take at least 3 to 4 weeks. In the last few years, it has also become possible to travel all the way from Adelaide to Darwin by train.
The UNESCO World Heritage listed Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world at approximately 123 kilometres long and 22 kilometres wide. It is a place of amazing beauty, with its long sandy beaches, dozens of freshwater lakes (many of which have their very own beaches), ancient rainforests, coloured rock formations, crystal clear creeks and even its own shipwreck. The main starting point for trips to Fraser Island is Hervey Bay. From here you can organise anything from 1-day trips that cover the main highlights of the island, to multi day camping trips that take in all that the island has to offer. Alternatively, a more adventurous choice is to take or hire your own 4x4 and explore the island by yourself, allowing you to go where you want, stay for as long as you want and camp wherever you like.
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world. It's no surprise that it is also one of Australia's most popular natural attractions. It is located off the coast of Queensland in northeastern Australia and stretches for some 2,600 kilometres, comprising 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands. A large section of the reef falls within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which was set up to protect it from the negative impacts of overfishing and tourism. Climate change forms a major threat to the reef with rising water temperatures causing mass coral bleaching.
The Great Ocean Road is one of the world's most stunning coastal drives, winding along Australia's southern coast. The undisputed highlight of the drive are the Twelve Apostles, but the Great Ocean Road leads past many more sights of interest, from bustling coastal towns like Lorne and Apollo Bay to the lush rainforests of Great Otway National Park. The Great Ocean Road was built between 1919 and 1932 by Australian World War I veterans, as a memorial to their fallen comrades. Their labour is all the more impressive considering the steep coastal mountains the road is built into.
Gulf Country, or also called Gulf Savannah, is an increasingly popular area in the northwest of Queensland. It refers to the area from Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory to the westcoast of Cape York in Queensland. Most visitors cross this area on their way from the Northern Territory to the eastcoast of Queensland, either via the sealed routes through Mount Isa and Tennant Creek, or by taking the official Savannah Way highway, which goes directly west from Normanton along mostly unsealed roads and basically connects Cairns in the northeast with Broome in the northwest of the country. Karumba along the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the inland towns of Mount Isa and Normanton are some of the main attractions in the region, as are the wide open spaces and big skies.
Kakadu National Park is a vast park the size of Israel in the Northern Territory, Australia, east of Darwin. A UNESCO World Heritage site, Kakadu supports a huge variety of flora and fauna, many species of which are rare or endemic. Historically, Kakadu was the home of Aboriginal people, and much of the current National Park is Aboriginal land. The area is also rich in Aboriginal rock art, with over 5,000 sites found.
The Kimberley is a vast area consisting of rugged ranges, canyons, waterfalls and pristine coastline. Kimberley, one of the 9 regions in Western Australia, is one the most rugged areas of Australia and a popular region for travellers. Most travellers come here for its surreal beauty, its wideness, big skies and beautiful gorges, pools and some of the most rewarding 4wd tracks in the country, including the popular Gibb River Road. Towns of interest include Broome, Derby and Kununurra.
Purnululu National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The national park is located approximately 300 kilometres south of Kununurra, with Halls Creek located to the south. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2003. The World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated in 2003, and the adopted boundary of the existing national park. Since its listing, the Government of Western Australia has reserved additional areas located adjacent to the World Heritage Area, including the Purnululu Conservation Park and the Ord River Regeneration Reserve. The Bungle Bungle Range, lying fully within the park, has elevations as high as 578 metres above sea level. It is famous for the sandstone domes, unusual and visually striking with their striping in alternating orange and grey bands. The banding of the domes is due to differences in clay content and porosity of the sandstone layers.
The Shark Bay World Heritage Area covers over 2.2 million hectares on the Western Australian coast. The park was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1991, in recognition of its unique marine life, including the stromatolites which provide evidence of early life on our planet. The extensive seagrass meadows found in the park play home to numerous endangered and threatened species. Another world renowned special attraction of the park is Monkey Mia, where a group of wild bottlenose dolphins have been coming ashore to the beach for more than 40 years.
Sydney Opera House, situated on Sydney's stunning harbour, is one of the world's most admired works of architecture. Since its opening in the 1970s, it has left a permanent impression and is now the defining symbol of modern Australia. If possible, it is well worth catching a performance here.
The Tasmanian Wilderness is a massive area covering 13,800 km², almost 20% of the island, in South West, Western and Central Tasmania. Many national parks and reserves make up the wilderness area, giving it a great diversity to explore. There are even archeological sites that are over 20,000 years old to be found in some of the limestone caves.
The Ghan is one of the best trips across the Red Centre of Australia. The passenger train operates along the Adelaide to Darwin railway and is almost 3,000 kilometres long. It takes around 48 hours to complete this fantastic trip, but you can also break your journey in several other places, including Alice Springs which is about halfway. You can visit places like Uluru and Kings Canyon National Park from here. Another option is to break your trip in Katherine and visit the Katherine Gorge. The original construction already began during the late 19th century, but it wasn't until 2004 when the final leg to Darwin was completed and people could travel across the heart of Australia by train. The train usually travels twice a week and is also more expensive than travelling by car, bus or even plane. Still, the service and charm are unbeatable!
The Great Ocean Walk is one of Australia's most spectacular coastal walks. The walk begins in the beautiful seaside town of Apollo Bay and finishes more than 100 kilometres later at the famous 12 Apostles. There are two ways you can approach this walk. You can choose to stay on track and stay in the designated camping spots or you may prefer to stay off track in some of the private accommodation which skirts the walk. Either way you are in for some amazing sights. Not every one chooses to do the whole walk but if you do you should give yourself about 7 days to do it. If you're staying on track you need to book your camp sites in advance.
Uluru (or Ayers Rock) is a large sandstone rock in the center of Australia and the country's most recognisable natural feature. Uluru is part of the larger Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. Kata Tjuta is native for the Olga's, another remarkable feature in this park. The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
The Whitsunday Islands are a collection of beautiful tropical islands ooff the coast of Queensland, a sailing and beach paradise. Most travellers arrive at the beautiful Whitsunday Islands by sailboat from Airlie Beach. It's a suitably romantic way to arrive - the islands are lovely. There are some great sections of reef to explore, by snorkelling or diving, and some fabulous beaches to kick back on including glorious Whitehaven Beach which changes shade as the light passes over. If you intend to sail and are on a budget, it is best to wait until the day before and book your trip in Airlie Beach as spare places on boats are often available at huge discounts.
Australia is known for its first class wines. Wine regions like the Barossa Valley (near Adelaide), the Yarra Valley (near Melbourne), Margaret River (in Western Australia) and the Hunter Valley (in New South Wales) are great places to visit for not just fantastic wine from the cellar door, but also some enjoyable scenery along the way.
For a listing of events in Australia by month, see also Events and Festivals in Australia
Australia is a large continent, so weather conditions vary greatly from one side to the other. However in general, summers are warm to hot and winters (May to September) are mild. Snow falls only on high ground.
Inland, much of the country is desert or semi-desert (the famous Outback). Summer days can be intolerably hot but nights are cold, especially during winter. The far north, including Kakadu and the Daintree forest, is lush and tropical because of the drenching rains and humidity of their summer - so it's best to visit these places in the Dry season from May to September, when the skies are a clear dazzling blue and the air is warm.
Most Australians live on the coast  because the climate is at its most pleasant there, ranging from tropical to Mediterranean as you travel south. Much of the south coast has a more European (i.e. unpredictable) climate - in Melbourne there is a saying, "if the weather doesn't suit you, wait 10 minutes".
If you are planning a working holiday of longer than 6 months, don't make the mistake of leaving all your warm clothing behind - you will acclimatise after a few weeks of 30 °C heat, and a balmy evening will suddenly feel quite chilly.
Practically every traveller arrives in Australia by plane. There are plenty of flights from Asia, Europe, the United States and the rest of Oceania. For those arriving by plane, the most common entry points are:
Other international airports frequently used include:
A few other smaller airports receive a few international flights, like Townsville, Hobart and Broome. Due to Australia's remoteness, flight times are long and often expensive.
Australia's national airline is Qantas. Virgin Australia is based in Brisbane and is the country's second-largest carrier. Over the past few years, two low-cost carriers, Jetstar and Tiger Airways, have grown in popularity.
It is possible to enter Australia by boat, though it is almost invariably the most expensive option. There are no regular connections between Australia and any other country. Several possibilities do exist though. The easiest option is to get on one of the large cruise ships that pass through Australia. Another, slightly less luxurious, but still expensive option, is to book a trip on a freighter. Finally, it is also possible to hitch a ride or crew a yacht headed to Australia.
Australia's size warrants air travel between major cities. For those with more time on their hands, Australia has some excellent highways and roads.
The domestic airline industry is currently dominated by Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar (a low-cost Qantas subsidiary) and most recently, Tiger Airways. Since the entry of Virgin Australia into the market, prices have become much more competitive, particularly between major cities.
Several dozens of airlines operate on the domestic market though, and apart from the larger ones mentioned above, there are also smaller airlines operating within certain areas of the country, like Air North and some very small airlines servicing outback landing strips. For more information about the airports and destinations, see the 'getting there' section, which also has links to the main airports and their destinations.
Buses and trains provide another option for travelling between cities. All long-distance services are of a high standard, air-conditioned and clean. The most famous train journeys are The Indian Pacific (Sydney - Adelaide - Perth), The Ghan (Adelaide - Alice Springs - Darwin) and The Overland (Melbourne - Adelaide), but thanks to their prestige, they are also expensive - much more so than travelling by air. However, you miss out on all the scenery on the way - and of course, train travel is better for the environment! For more information about schedules and prices check the Rail Australia website.
For the very long distances travelled in Australia, bus travel can be uncomfortable because you can't get up to stretch your legs - but there's no doubt that taking the bus is the cheapest way to get around. Go to any backpackers' hostel and you'll find plenty of choice. Look out for the smaller operators who run services travelling off the major highways - the trip will take longer but will be much more interesting.
Travellers with a valid overseas licence can drive in Australia without the need for any other licence, provided the licence is in English (or has an English translation). You must carry your licence with you whenever you are driving. Hiring a car is pretty simple and cars can range from cheap to high quality. Air conditioning is essential during the hot summer months! Remember to drive on the left. If in doubt about the speed limit, drive 50 km/h in cities and towns or 100 km/h on highways.
Although touring by car can seem attractive (and in fact, many Australians dream of doing a round-Australia road trip), the reality can be very different. Distances are far longer than many visitors are used to, and the scenery can be surprisingly monotonous. Sydney to Brisbane is a 12-hour drive, and while the Australian bush looks exotic at first, it has much less variety than a European or American landscape. If you are thinking of driving by car, make sure you allow plenty of time to recover as you will get tired from long periods of driving. Avoid driving at night, as this is when most of Australia's freight is on the roads in huge trucks, and accidents are common.
Having said that, public transport in smaller towns is scarce, so having a car is useful if you want to visit sights away from the major cities. There are plenty of companies you could choose to hire a car from, including Redspot,  Avis, Budget, Europcar, Hertz and Thrifty. Car hire is often not available to drivers under 25, or if it is, it's more expensive for younger drivers (generally the additional insurance cost, varying on the provider, is around $25-$40 per day is added to the daily rental cost).
If you decide to visit Tasmania, you can get there by ferry (Spirit of Tasmania) from Melbourne. The service runs most nights between Melbourne and Devonport and during peak periods there is also a day service. Most people who use the ferry are Australians who want to take their own car with them. It's hard to justify otherwise, as it's more expensive than going by air.
All visitors - apart from citizens of New Zealand - require a visa in advance of travel.
If you are visiting for a holiday of less than 90 days, there are three types of visas you may apply for, depending on your nationality.
Visitor Visa (subclass 600). Passport holders of 55 countries, including all the ETA and eVisitor eligible countries and Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, Kuwait, Maldives, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE can make applications on-line. Other nationalities must apply using the paper form, and may need to visit an embassy or visa processing centre.
Like the ETA and eVisitor, a Visitor 600 is by default issued for a three month stay. Unlike the other options however, a 600 visa can be issued for a longer stay of up to one year. For more than a three month stay, you will likely be asked for supporting documentation about the reason for your visit and your ties to your country of origin and may need to attend an interview. Depending on your nationality, the embassy or visa processing centre may also require you to have an Australian sponsor before issuing the visa. The fee is $140. ETAs and eVisitors are valid for multiple entries within a 12-month period. If you're eligible for either, it may be easier to stay the three months you're allowed, go to New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand or some other country reachable by a low cost airline for a few days and come back - restarting the 90-day clock. Doing this more than once, however, may cause immigration authorities to become suspicious, so proceed with caution if you pursue this route.There is a special arrangement for parents of Australians, including Australian permanent residents. The 600 visa can be valid for 18 months, three years, or five years and allow a maximum stay of 12 months during an 18-month period, depending on the circumstances.
In most cases, ETAs and eVisitors are approved instantly and the visa will be issued and available for use immediately. If further enquiries are needed you may be asked to return to the application system later to see if you've been approved. Over 90% are processed the same day. In the worst-case scenario your application can be diverted for manual checks that can take months. if you have a complex national history, or any criminal record (including minor offences) you should allow plenty of time for the application.
If you are visiting Australia to work, study or for medical treatment, check to make sure you have the right kind of visa, as a tourist visa may not be sufficient. Breaching the conditions or planning to breach the conditions of your visa will result in visa cancellation, deportation, and/or a period of exclusion.
For all tourist visa classes you must be able to demonstrate your ability to support yourself financially for the time you intend to spend in Australia and meet character requirements. If you have a criminal conviction, contact an Australian Embassy or visa processing centre before applying or making travel arrangements.
If you are transiting through Australia, remain airside for a maximum of 8 hours, have a confirmed onward booking, have the correct entry documentation for the onward destination and are a citizen of New Zealand, the European Union, Andorra, Argentina, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Nauru, Norway, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South Africa, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Korea (ROK), Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (regardless of nationality status), the United States, Vanuatu or Vatican City, you do not need to apply for any advance visa. All other passengers who transit through Australia must apply for a free-of-charge Transit Visa (subclass 771) before travel.
New Zealand citizens may travel to and work in Australia for any length of time without a pre-arranged visa - a Special Category New Zealand Citizen visa (subclass 444) will be granted to them on arrival. Non-citizen permanent residents of New Zealand are not eligible for visa-free entry. New Zealand citizens may still be denied entry on the basis of criminal convictions and should seek advice from an Australian diplomatic mission before travel.
At selected airports, visitors who are citizens of Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States may make use of the SmartGate for automated immigration clearance when entering Australia. Being able to use SmartGate does not exempt you from visa requirements.
There is no paperwork to complete when leaving Australia, just a simple passport check.
Australia has strict quarantine requirements regarding importing animal and plant derived products (any food, wooden products, seeds, etc.) You must declare all such material, even if the items are permitted. Baggage is frequently scanned and may be examined by dogs. You may be fined $220 on-the-spot if you accidentally fail to declare, or even prosecuted in serious cases. Declared material will be examined and, depending on the circumstances, may be retained, disposed of, returned to you, or treated by quarantine at your expense. (You may have to pick the item up at a later time.) Processed and sealed chocolates and other confectionery are usually permitted after being declared and examined, as are reasonable quantities of infant formula with an accompanying infant. Different rules apply depending on the origin country of foods, and the state in which you are entering Australia. Check with the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for more details.
Travellers who are 18 years old or older are allowed to bring up to 2.25 litres of alcoholic beverages and up to 25 cigarettes or 25 grams of other tobacco products (including cigars) into Australia duty-free. These items may not be imported by anybody under the age of 18, and travellers who exceed their duty free allowance are liable to tax on all goods of that category, not just the amount in excess of the limit.
Some shells, coral and items made from a protected species are also prohibited to discourage the trade in items that may originate from a threatened ecosystem or species.
While there are no restrictions on the amount of money that can be brought in or out, Australian customs also requires you to declare if you are travelling with $10,000 or more (AUD or its equivalent in foreign currency) and you will be asked to complete some paperwork. Not declaring may expose you to a fine, possible seizure of the cash, or in the worst case even arrest.
Australia has its own dollar (AUD), which, as of 2012, has been trading near parity with the US dollar. Notes come in $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 and coins come in 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢, $1 and $2. Most places will accept credit cards and debit cards, though charge cards are less commonly accepted.
Nowadays, Australia is a rather expensive destination when compared with Western Europe or the USA. Accommodation and food are generally good quality, but even backpacker hostels charge around $20-$40 for a bunk bed. Hotel rooms are hard to find for under $100. When eating out most main meals start at around $15. A budget of $50 per day for accommodation, meals and transport should be considered the bare minimum.The Australian Dollar is currently (November 2012) very strong, thus it makes Australia a rather expensive holiday destination. When eating out, tipping is not compulsory, though it has become much more common. A 10% tip is more than enough and should only be considered if the service was of a high standard. A more common practice is to simply round the bill upwards. Tipping taxi drivers is not required, although again it is common practise to round the metered fare upwards.
The major Australian banks include: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, Bank of Queensland, HSBC, ING Direct, and Citibank,
Setting up a bank account in Australia is not that difficult, although you do need appropriate identification and some banks ask for proof of address (which can be hard to provide if you've only just arrived!). However you need only show up at the bank with your passport (which includes a visa providing the right to work and/or study) within the first four weeks of entering the country, and that's all the identification or introduction you'll need. Just be certain to really do this within those first four weeks, because after that you need several additional forms of identification (and things like overseas drivers licenses don't cut it.)
Ensure you advise your bank of your Tax File Number to avoid higher rates of taxation on interest earned.
One of the most popular ways to come to Australia is under a Working Holiday Visa. This option is only available for citizens of Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, aged between 18 and 30, without any dependent children. With a Working Holiday Visa, you can travel around Australia for up to 12 months and work for each employer for up to 6 months. [3]
If you are not eligible for the Working Holiday Visa, you are generally still able to obtain a Tourist Visa for 3 months.
For citizens of Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey and the USA, there is another visa called Work and Holiday Visa, which allows tertiary-educated people aged 18 to 30 a working holiday of up to 12 months. Only about 100 of these are released per country each year, so these aren't easy to obtain. [4]
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, Seek, My Career, CareerOne are several of the most popular online job search websites.
Another popular option is to do volunteer work on organic farms through a scheme known as WWOOF. In exchange for 4-6 hours of work per day, you will receive food & lodging. You won't receive any financial rewards, but it is a good way to meet local families. There are over 1,500 host farms spread throughout the country. You need to be at least 17 to join the program.
WWOOFing in Australia can be done on a tourist visa, as WWOOFers are not meant to do work that would otherwise go to a paid employee. [5]
Before Commencing WorkIf you are coming to work in Australia (on an approved Visa with working rights) you will need to apply for an Australian Tax File Number.  A tax file number (TFN) is a unique number issued by the Australian Taxation Office. Only one TFN is issued to you for your lifetime.
All employers in Australia are legally obliged to ask for your Tax File Number when you commence work; for every employer you work for, you must fill in a Tax Declaration Form. While it is not compulsory to have a TFN, if you do not have one a higher amount of tax will be withheld than is necessary. Getting a tax File Number is relatively easy -you can apply online through the Australia Taxation Office (ATO).. There's also a really useful and informative online video that explains the basics of Tax in Australia.
Leaving AustraliaIf you are a non-Australian Resident, you may apply for a refund of some of the Income Tax you have paid whilst working in Australia. To get a refund, you need to complete an Income Tax Return.
Everyone working in Australia MUST file a Tax Return at the end of the financial year 30 June (submission deadline is 31 October) or when they permanently depart Australia - there are fines in place if this is not done.
You can complete and submit a Tax Return yourself or you may choose to use a tax agent or accountant  To independently lodge your Tax Return, download the appropriate forms (known as a  TaxPack ) from the ATO website. Alternatively, the Tax Pack, is obtainable from post offices and newsagencies at tax time.
If you’re in a hurry, for a small fee you can get an Express Tax Return Kit from the Post Office. Otherwise, see a tax agent who will arrange your Tax Return for a fee. If you leave the country before your refund is processed the ATO can send your refund cheque to any address in Australia or overseas.
Irrespective of the method used to submit your Tax Return, you must attach your Group Certificate(s). A Group Certificate is the statement of earnings that your employer will give you when you finish working for them. Make sure you collect a Group Certificate (statement of earnings) from each employer when you cease work.
Superannuation (otherwise known as Super) is a way of saving money to provide benefits for retirement, disability or your beneficiaries in case of death. Internationally, Super is often referred to internationally as ‘retirement income’ or ‘pensions’.
If you earn over $450 a month in Australia (before tax), it is compulsory for your employer to contribute an portion of your salary/wages to a Superannuation Fund. Your employer must pay a minimum of 9% of your earnings for your ordinary hours of work into your super account each quarter. These payments are also called Super Guarantee Payments.
Upon leaving Australia permanently, you may claim your Super Guarentee Payments. After departing Australia, you can claim your super at any time from your Superannuation Fund or (if it has been more than 6 months since your departure) the ATO. You can apply for the payment of your superannuation online or by downloading the appropriate forms from the ATO. Once your application has been processed you should receive a cheque in 28 days.
Australia has a high quality tertiary education system, which attracts hundreds of thousands of students from abroad. International students pay higher course fees than their Australian counterparts. However, when fees are compared to similar universities in the US or UK, they do still represent excellent value.
Additionally other education sectors of interest to prospective international visitors and travellers for studying in Australia are English courses, school, TAFE or vocational training, higher education and research.  Many private colleges in city centres offer recognised English and career or technical training with lower fees, multiple start dates, employment assistance and further study pathways.
In order to study in Australia, certain minimum requirements must be met, including a sufficient level of English language proficiency plus genuine student GS and genuine temporary entrant GTE tests for student visa application. If you don't meet the entry requirements, you can enrol in English, University Preparation or Foundation Studies to prepare you for further study.
If you are not an Australian citizen you require a student visa, which can be obtained at Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIBP).  Many nationalities can apply for thier first student visa onshore in Australia depending upon their visa assessment level and/or eligibility for streamlined visa processing SVP if stuyding higher education.
Detailed information on studying in Australia can be found on the government's website Study In Australia.
International students can work 20 hours per week during term or semester, and full time during vacation.  If a student has graduated after two years of higher education study they are also eligible for the post graduate work visa, or in the case of vocational the 'Job Ready Program' for migration skills assessment and work visa.
English is Australia's national language. Numerous Aboriginal languages are spoken throughout the country. Kriol, an Australian creole language, is spoken by about 30,000 indigenous people in northern Australia.
Within the major cities, there are large immigrant populations which tend to congregate together in certain suburbs. Greek, Italian, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Arabic and Indonesian are some of the largest. It's not uncommon to find yourself in a suburb where all the shop signs are in Korean or Greek!
For all intents and purposes though, mainstream Australia is still a very monolingual society. Many of its inhabitants don't speak any language other than English, so a basic level of English is essential for any traveller, unless you are on an organised tour.
Apart from the commonly heard slang words (G'day and Crikey are now used worldwide thanks to Paul Hogan and the late Steve Irwin) Australian English has a lot of other slang and idioms that are particular to Australia, including various forms of rhyming slang adopted from the English convicts (many of whom were Cockney) and since developed.  For example, the check or bill in a restaurant may be referred to as the "Bobby Fisher" - as in "the check, mate" - or the "Jack and Jill" - the bill.  A few other examples: "you beauty" or "you beaut" means "that's great!" or "good one"; a cobber is a friend, or a good mate; a swag is a sleeping bag or blanket roll, "strewth" and "blimey" are expressions of disgust or amazement, as is "stone the crows"; "too right" means I agree with you, calling someone a real "galah" is not terribly nice and finally (importantly!) you may hear people say something like "it hurts like buggery" they don't necessarily know what that feels like - it's just an expression, used unconsciously mostly. Similarly, if someone tells you something is "back of Bourke" it doesn't mean it's anywhere near Bourke (outback), just a long way away from where you are.
Australia's traditional staples of meat pies, fish & chips and barbecued meat have in recent times been challenged by an increasingly diverse diet of fine cuisine from around the world. As immigration increased in Australia in the latter half of the last century, with it came exciting new tastes that have turned the country into one of the most diverse culinary landscapes in the world. Italian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Lebanese, Vietnamese, Spanish ... there is a never ending range of options for the discerning diner.
For those interested in tasting some of Australia's native wildlife, it is becoming increasingly common to find things like kangaroo steak on restaurant menus and even as a gourmet item in the supermarkets. Bush foods are still a rarity in day-to-day life, however they are increasingly being embraced because of their natural resilience to the Australian climate and can now often be found in supermarkets as gourmet items.
Most states in Australia now have a ban on smoking in restaurants. These bans are becoming increasingly strict and are also starting to restrict smoking in pubs or clubs when they aren't serving food .
Many restaurants will contain the abbreviation BYO in the window. This stands for "Bring Your Own" and means that customers are able to bring their own alcohol and will likely be charged a "corkage" fee by the establishment. Some restaurants will be "BYO Only", which means the only way to get alcohol is by bringing it yourself. If you are intending to BYO, be sure to check requirements with the restaurant - most BYO liscense only allow patrons to bring wine and beer; if in doubt, avoid bringing spirits, liquors or pre-mixed drinks.
Australia is well built-up for tourism, so there is ample variety of selection when it comes to finding accommodation. As with most Western cities, you can find your usual assortment of 5-star hotels, as well as plenty options for the budget traveller. As you head away from the major cities and towns, accommodation might be a little harder to find, but unless you're going somewhere completely off the map, you should be able to find something. If you're going somewhere completely off the map, take a tent.
Contrary to the popular myth generated by marketing overseas, Fosters is not "Australian for beer". There are quite a few breweries that can be considered more popular among locals, including Crown, James Boag's and Victoria Bitter (VB). Australia is also a world famous exporter of wine. Visiting one of the many wine regions in Australia is a popular tourist activity.
The legal drinking age in Australia is 18 and it is strictly enforced. Anyone under the age of 25 should expect to be asked for ID when purchasing alcohol. The only ID that would generally be accepted for people travelling from outside Australia would be a passport.
Alcohol can only be purchased from licensed venues, such as "bottle shops", bars, clubs and a large number of restaurants. Wine can sometimes also be purchased at the vineyard's cellar door, allowing you the possibility of sampling the various wines produced before making your choice. Some restaurants allow you to bring your own alcohol. This is advertised by the letters BYO. Usually, such establishments will charge "corkage", which can vary in price and is usually charged per person drinking. This is still almost always a cheaper option than ordering from a restaurant's wine list, as those prices can be marked up 100% or more.
Drive-through bottle shops are a common Australian phenomena, allowing you to order your drinks from the comfort of your car window. But don't try drinking that alcohol or even opening the bottle in your car, as that is strictly prohibited.
Driving while under the influence of alcohol is permitted up to a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05. Learner drivers and probationary drivers are not allowed any alcohol in their blood. Drinking and driving is taken very seriously in Australia and random breath tests are not uncommon at all. "Booze Buses" will block a road and divert a random selection of passing cars to a breath testing station.
Australia's public health system is run by Medicare. If you are a citizen of Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Malta or Italy, you are entitled to subsidised health services [6] Otherwise, it is highly recommended to take out travel insurance, as medical services are quite expensive in Australia.
There are no required vaccinations for travel to Australia. There is one exception though. You need a yellow fever vaccination if you have travelled to a country (7 days or less before entering Australia) where that disease is widely prevalent.
However, vaccines for DTP (Dyphtheria, Tetanus and Polio), Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are recommended, as well as vaccines for Japanese encephalitis, depending on where and how long you will be travelling(reference). Dengue sometimes occurs, but only in the northeast of the country. There is no vaccination, so buy mosquito repellent (preferably with 50% DEET), and sleep under a net. Also wear long sleeves if possible.
Finally, other possible health issues include diarrhea and other general travellers' diseases like motion sickness. Watch what you eat and drink and in case you get it, drink plenty of fluids (to prevent dehydration) and bring ORS.
Australia is generally a safe place, though crime is by no means non-existent. 000 is the emergency telephone number in Australia, but the international GSM mobile emergency telephone number 112 also works on mobile phones.
Many travellers to Australia are concerned about crocodiles, sharks, and venomous spiders and snakes. Australia is certainly home to some deadly predators, including most of the top 10 of venomous snakes in the world. While these threats are near non-existent in Australia's large cities, you are well advised to take the right precautions when you are out in the 'bush'. Up north, don't swim in waters that you haven't verified as being safe. Usually, there are warning signs about 'salties' (salt water crocodiles, the 'freshies' are less of a concern). Shark attacks do occur but chances are very slim. Also note that spiders and snakes will usually notice you before you notice them and they will disappear immediately.
Bushfires are a common occurrence in parts of Australia, sometimes with devastating consequences. It is important to understand how to gauge the risks as you travel throughout the country. In 2009, a national Fire Danger Ratings system was introduced to ensure all the states used the same terminology and standards. The levels of danger are as follows:
For most travellers, any fire danger rating over Very High should make you think about leaving. The differences between the ratings are really targetted at people living in the area who may decide to stay and defend their homes against ember attacks. If you are going to leave an area, the recommendation is to leave the night before or early in the morning. The worst place to be caught by a fire is in your car, so if you see smoke or flames then the safest place to be is in a building or on a sports oval where there is not much to burn around you.
It is certainly not a good idea to go bush walking or camping on days where there is a high risk of fire. If you plan to go camping in the bush during summer, always check weather forecasts in advance.
Fire Danger Ratings are published on the firefighting websites for each state and broadcast on the radio, tv and published in newspapers.
It is also important to know when a Total Fire Ban applies to the area you're in. These are in place to minimise the risk of fires starting. These bans don't just rule out open fires and solid-fuel barbecues, but also things like welding and using machinery that might cause sparks.
Internet cafés are very common in the larger Australian cities and popular tourist destinations. However, once you leave the major population centres, you might have trouble finding somewhere to log on. Free wifi is getting more and more common (either with or without a code) in places like restaurants, some bars and coffee places and hotels. Sometimes a fee is required.
Australia is on a GSM 900/1800 network, so if you have an unlocked phone that works on those frequencies, you will be able to buy a prepaid SIM-card and stick into your phone when you're in Australia. You will receive a new Australian phone number with the SIM-card.
To dial out of Australia use the prefix 0011, followed by the calling code of the country you are trying to reach, followed by the area code of the city/town (without the 0!) and finally the phone number.
Within Australia, it is necessary to add an area code to the phone numbers if you are calling from outside the area. Below are Australia's area codes:
000 is the emergency telephone number in Australia, but the international GSM mobile emergency telephone number 112 also works on mobile phones.
Australia Post is the government's postal service. Most suburbs will have at least one post office. Opening times are mostly from around 8:00 or 9:00am to 5:00pm though larger ones keep longer hours sometimes. A standard letter or postcard sent within Australia will cost $0.60. Internationally, it costs $1.70 to send postcards anywhere in the world. Letters cost $1.85 to send within the Asia Pacific region and $2.60 to anywhere else in the world.[7]. It is also possible to send things as parcels or by express mail. You can also use use private courier companies like TNT, UPS or DHL as they are competitive and reliable.

I spent a year living in and travelling through (part of) Australia, and returned a couple of years later to hit spots I still managed to miss. I never made it further north on the west coast than the Pinnacles Desert, nor to Darwin (shame on me!), and avoided a lot of the more touristy spots on the East Coast, but other than that I explored most of Adelaide to Cairns, with emphasis on the Melbourne and Sydney area.
I have travelled by car from Melbourne to Darwin and from Sydney to Cairns, both along the coast as well as through the Outback. Probably I can help you with some Outback questions and how to travel around by car.
I live in Melbourne, Australia. If you have any questions about what life is like here or what you should see while visiting, just drop me a note. I'm always happy to help out.

I currently live in Sydney, but I wasn't born here. I moved here two years ago with my family and have been attending uni here since then, so I've gotten to know lots of different areas of the city, and I have plenty of contacts if you need information about the Blue Mountains or other areas close to the city. I can help orienting you as a traveller or as someone looking for real local flavour. I also know my way around Melbourne as a traveller and can really help out with local restaurants to both Sydney and Melbourne!

### Italy ###
For only $3 per month you can become a Travellerspoint Supporter
              and enjoy an ad free experience.
Italy is the home of culture, some of soccer's finest teams, the Roman Catholic church and quality food and dishes. Quite simply, this is a place of such diversity that the only thing that will stop you spending the rest of your days here is an empty wallet. Museums display some of the most beautiful art works ever made; but the living, breathing Italy that operates outside museum doors has enough beauty to suffice the average visitor. Stroll down the streets of Rome, Florence, Naples or Venice, and you will be struck by the wealth of history and culture tied up in the cobbled streets, baroque styled buildings, or beautiful chapels.
Natural beauty abounds, too: gorgeous stretches of coastline; the Alps sealing off the northern border; and the people, of course. Best of all, Italy is home of pizza, pasta and cappuccino, so expect a culinary experience superior to any Pizza Hut meal you've ever had. Many have flocked to Tuscany and Umbria to find the real Italy. But much to be explored are the Le Marche and latterly the Abruzzo - where property prices are beginning to soar! Each region has its own particular choice of dishes
The history of the Italian peninsula can be divided quite neatly in seven distinct periods, spanning almost three millennia of human civilisation.
The earliest evidence of human presence on the Italian peninsula dates back to 16,000 BC, although nothing much can be said of the period before the late Iron Age (approximately 800 BC) when early Greeks founded colonies on the southeast of the peninsula and Sicily. Etruscan presence in central Italy dates back to the same period, who were to rule these lands as a kingdom that prospered almost 700 years. The principal remains of Etruscan civilisation can still be visited near Cerveteri; much of the Greek remains can be seen in Campania and on Sicily.
The Roman period consists of three main eras. The era of (Etruscan) kings (753 BC - 509 BC), during this time Rome did not extended beyond present day Italy. During the Etruscan era there was very little Greek influence. The Roman Republic, which went from 509 BC to 31 BC, this was the time that the senate ruled Rome and it eventually became more and more corrupt. This lead to Julius Caesar's storming into Rome with his soldiers and making himself dictator.  After the Senate organized an assassination which made Rome descend into chaos. Augustus Caesar came to power starting the Roman Empire, which went from 31 BC to 476 AD. With the rise of Christianity the empire changed greatly and started to deteriorate. The empire was split in 286 and at roughly the same time christianity was legalized.
In 476 AD due to great corruption and inability even to protect the city of Rome the western empire fell. Although most areas continued to keep Roman laws and legal systems and the legacy of the Catholic Church can be felt to this day. After 476 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, remained together until 1453 AD with its capital in current day Istanbul. Several times it tried to retake the western empire but was never successful because of cultural difference between Catholics and Orthodox beliefs, also the identity of tribes had grown so strong that rebuilding a larger Roman identity could not be done.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Italy existed of many smaller states and city states, and was invaded many times by foreign forces. Slowly out of this patchwork of states, some bigger more dominant states emerged in the late Middle Ages. The kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence, the Republic of Siena and the Papal States the centre, the Genoese and the Milanese the north and west, and the Venetians the east. Sicily and Sardinia were controled by the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon.
The Renaissance was an extremely important period in Italian history, and in European history, and brought along numerous political, philosophical, literary, cultural, social and religious reforms. The Renaissance was so called because it was a "rebirth" of many classical ideas that had long been buried in the chapters of classical Antiquity. During the Renaissance Florence became the most important city in the region, and many of the most famous artists, like Botticelli, Da Vinci and Michelangelo worked there. This all happened under the rule of the Medici family which was almighty for some centuries, and had family members elected as Pope. During the Renaissance some of the most famous pieces of arts were created, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the most important one: The paintings at the Sistine Chappel by Michelangelo.
From the late 15th century France and Spain, competed to conquer the several kingdoms. Spain succeeded in this and took firm control over the country. In the south this control was the thoughest, and is the cause for the economical division between the north and the south today. After the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, it was Austria which were the dominant force in Italy, after it acquired the State of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples.
The French revolution, and other revolutions taking place in Europe, sparked the idea that a united Italy could be possible on the peninsula. It took three wars to achieve an independent and unified Italy, but that goal was finally realised in 1870, when the French, which controlled the Papal States, abandoned their positions in Rome during the Franco-Prussian War. Soon after that Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. In the last decades of the 19th century Italy developed into a colonial power by adding the colonies of Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese (a group of what are now Greek Islands, but where conquered from Turkey). In all cases these colonies were taken by force.
Until 1915 Italy was neutral in World War I, but became involved with the signing of the treaty of London. As a result of that Italy received obtained just Bolzano-Bozen, Trento, Trieste and Istria after the war, as compensation. This however was less than what was promised when signing the treaty. In the years after the war the power struggle that took place in the whole of Europe between liberals, communists and fascists also reached Italy. With the liberals supporting the fascists to prevent a socialist state, Mussolini could rise to power in Italy, leading Italy into World War II on the side of Nazi-Germany. During the war Italy lost all of its colonies, was invaded in june 1943 and remained a battleground for the remaining years of the war. After the war, the Kingdom became a republic, and became a member of NATO, and a founding member of the E.E.C. (later the E.U.).
Italy is located in Southern Europe and is sometimes also called the boot of Europe, which describes best the shape of the peninsula. It lies between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. In the north of the peninsula you can find the the Alps. The Apennine mountains streche far to the south and form the backbone of the country. Of the total surface area of Italy, 75% is covered by hills and mountains. Italy's highest point is located on Mont Blanc (4,810 metres. In Italy there are a number of vulcano's of which Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna, Vulcano and the Stromboli are active. Vesuvius is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of Pompeii and Herculanum. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active caldera, the Campi Flegrei north-west of Naples. The Po, Italy's longest river (652 kilometres0), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the Padan plain on its way to the Adriatic Sea. The five largest lakes are Garda, Maggiore, Como, Trasimeno and Bolsena. The largest flat area is the Po valley in the north. Besides the peninsula the territory of Italy also comprises several islands, of which the islands of Sicily and Sardinia are the largests. Italy has international borders with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia in the north. Inside of Italy, it has borders with the two small states of San Marino and Vatican City.
Italy is divided into 20 regions, which fall into the following areas.
Florence was the birth place of the renaissance and the home to some of the world's greatest minds and artists. Amazing churches with works of art designed by some of the most renowned artists in the world to museums that have paintings and sculptures that the entire world knows like The David. Any trip to Florence is not complete without wine, cheese or seeing the tombs of some of the world's most well known minds.
Milan is located in the north of the country and is mainly known as a major international fashion city. Apart from this, the city has many cultural monuments to visit, like the Duomo, one of the largest Gothic churches in the world. The city has almost 4 million inhabitants, making it one of the largest cities in Italy. The canal district is one of the best places for outdoor eats and great Italian cuisine!
All roads lead to Rome and this city is a great place to visit. From amazing Roman ruins to Catholic churches that can shock and inspire any first time travellers to the veterans, this is a place where history and culture come alive in stunning ways. Rome is a city that can consume an entire vacation and where anyone can find something to love.
Canals, romance and a former world power, Venice is completely amazing. Built on a series of islands and reclaimed land Venice grew into a naval super power that controlled the Mediterranean world for several centuries. Today it is known for romance, amazing seafood, churches and being a truly unique city in the world. No trip to Venice is complete without a stroll in Saint Marks Square.  Venice© NantesFCOther CitiesBergamo - smaller city in the north with excellent food and easy access to many other places. A city in two parts: ancient hilltop core and lower 1600s-onwards 'modern' centre.Turin - in the northwest.Naples - southwest of Rome on the coast, famous for nearby Pompeii, Herculaneum and Vesuvius.Catania - second city of Sicily.Pisa - northwest, near Florence. Famous for its leaning tower but with much more to offer.Siena - in Toscane, with UNESCO-listed historical centre and famous for its Palio (horse race).Bari - southeastern port city with ancient roots and a fascinating, atmospheric historical core.Palermo - capital and largest city of Sicily.Genoa - northwestern port city.Bologna - northeast, famous for its food and with some excellent historical sites. UNESCO-listed Ravenna is nearby.Trieste - northeastern coastal city.Verona - central north, Roman amphitheatre, interesting historical centre and particularly famous for Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'.Brindisi - southeastern port city with Roman roots.Lecce - On the heel of the peninsula in the region called Salento together with Otranto and Gallipoli, magical places in a perfect combination of sea and Baroque.Ancona - central west along the coast.Modena - northern Italy, famous for its history with sports cars like Ferrari.
Pompeii is a Roman city, near current day Naples, that was buried in ash by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The ash from this eruption blanketed the city and killing everyone that lived there. A nice side affect of the ash was that is preserved the city in perfect shape, like a snap shot taken in time. Although not the biggest or most important city in the Roman Empire it was large city and gives people a chance to see hoe regular and wealthy Romans lived their lives. This is a great sight and one of the best ruins in the world.
The Colosseum is the largest Roman amphitheater every built. Its construction was completed in 80 AD and it has been attracting spectators ever since. At its heigh it could hold over fifty thousand blood thirsty people. Although the current day visitor just wants to marvel in its awe and wonder the average Roman citizen wanted to see battles to the death between gladiators. Today the Colosseum is one of the most popular sights in Rome.
To many the Roman Forum may just look like a huge field littered with rocks, but you have to remember that this once was the focal point of an empire that lasted a thousand years. The Forum was layed out along side the Via Sacra, which leads from the Colosseum to Capitol Hill. In the forum you will find the ruins of many temples and buildings, but also some buildings that survived.
Venice is a truly amazing city. Little buildings built on little islands that slowly grew together with narrow alleys and little canals linking them. One can spend days wandering the streets of Venice taking in all the beauty and glory. The Grand Canal of Venice runs through the city in a S-shape pattern and links the city. Like all major highways it is constantly busy with traffic, but unlike the highways of the modern world the Grand Canal is teaming with the hustle and bustle of thousands of boats. Standing on one of the few bridges that crosses the Grand Canal a traveller can enjoy the activity below.
The UNESCO listed Aeolian Islands are a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily, named after the demigod of the winds Aeolus. The locals residing on the islands are known as Aeolians. The Aeolian Islands are a popular tourist destination in the summer, and attract up to 200,000 visitors annually.Stromboli© Cpt_RonBecause the largest island is Lipari, the islands are sometimes referred to as the Lipari Islands or Lipari group. The other islands include Vulcano, Salina, Stromboli, Filicudi, Alicudi, Panarea and Basiluzzo.Mount VesuviusMount Vesuvius is a volcano that earned its place in the history books in 79 AD, when an eruption covered the town of Pompeii under a layer of lava. It also caused huge destruction to the town of Hercalaneum. The stratovolcano, considered one of the most dangerous in its class, could do a lot of harm to the city of Naples. The last eruption of the mountain was in 1944. Today, the volcano and its slopes are a national park. There are a number of paths leading up the mountain, and there is even parking space at 200 metres below the summit. The rest of the climb has to be done by foot.Mount EtnaMount Etna is the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, and also one of the most active in the world. It is situated on the eastern part of the island of Sicily, near the city of Catania. The mountain is almost always in a state of eruption the last couple of years. The best way to get onto the mountain is from the south, via a road that leads up to the mountain. At an altitude of 1900 metres, there is a parking lot. There used to be a cable-car going up the mountain, but this was destroyed and hasn't yet been rebuilt. From the parking lot most trails lead to the Valley of Oxes (Valle del Bove). The first of the four active craters is not that far away. There are buses going up the mountain until the parking lot, and there are a couple of tour agencies in Taormina offering tours to the mountain.Cinque TerreVernazza, Cinque Terre© Rish_n_BenCinque Terre (literally meaning five lands) are 5 villages on the Italian Riviera.

Palio di Siena (2 July and 16 August) - Palio di Siena is one of the most intense, and short, horse races in the world. It is held twice a year in the angled Plazza del Campo at the center of Siena. The horses represent the different districts in the city and have to run around the Plazza for three laps. The winning horse does not need its rider in order to win.
Venice Carnival  - The Venice Carnival, witnessed by thousands of tourists from all round the world, is one of the most beautiful Carnival Festivals in the world, held annually in Venice. The origins of the Carnival date back to the year 1296, when the Senate made the carnival official and declaring the day a public holiday. Masks are a central feature of the Venetian Carnival and the streets of the city is full of people with different varieties of colourful masks. Masks were used in the past so that no distinction could be made between the nobility and the common people and all could participate in the fun.
The traditional pre-Lent festival of Carnevale takes place all over Italy on Shrove Tuesday in February, 40 days before the start of Easter week. Venice is famous for its masked parades and balls and, in Ivrea, the festival ends with an orange-throwing contest. Across the land Carnevale celebrations include eating, drinking, dancing, singing, street performances and loads of food and wine.
The Festa della Donna in March is the celebration of women’s day, taking place all over Italy with men bringing gifts of yellow mimosa flowers to their mothers, wives or other family members. Concerts and local events are held around town and most restaurants offer special Festa della Donna menus.
Also known as Fathers’ Day, this March festival celebrates St Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary. Bonfires, pageants depicting scenes from the saint’s life, special food and gifts from children to their dads are commonplace. The Spring Festival often coincides with Fathers’ Day.
Easter week in Italy falls either in late March or early April and is a combination of solemn processions, traditions and rituals followed by joyous celebration on Easter Sunday. With Rome at the heartland, the Pope gives his Easter Message to millions assembled in St Peter’s Square.
Saint Mark is Venice’s patron saint, who is celebrated in late April in St Mark’s Square and the magnificent basilica. Processions, fireworks, concerts, street entertainers and other events mark the day, and Venetians give a red rose to their lovers in true Italian fashion.
If Assisi is on the vacation agenda, the best time to arrive is in May for the spectacular Calendimaggio festival. It’s a costumed recreation of medieval and Renaissance Italian life, with two ancient city wards competing to offer the best concerts, shows, processions, archery and crossbow displays and singing. Glorious floral displays, flags, torches and candles adorn the streets.
This week-long cultural event takes place in Florence and is a program of music, art, wine and cuisine attracting well-known artists, as well as many thousands of visitors. Exhibitions, performances, pre-concert dinners and receptions, displays of Tuscan wines and food and even cooking demonstrations are found around town.
The birthday of Santa Rosalia is one of Sicily’s largest festivals, and takes place in July all over Palermo, the island’s capital. Music and feasts are highlights, along with a massive procession led by a 50 ft. float containing a band and an image of the saint.
The second week in November sees top-class horses and famous riders arrive in the ancient Italian city of Verona for its International Horse Show. The event opens with a grand parade through the city that features costumed riders and decorated animals.
December’s Christmas festivities begin late in November with Florence’s Noel Week aimed at kids, hosting a Nativity Village, games and Santa Claus. Parades, feasts, bonfires and music adorn Immaculate Conception day, while four other saint’s days are celebrated in December. Christmas Day events in Italy are family-oriented, and the 12th day of Christmas concludes with elaborate gift-giving. On December 31, the entire country celebrates the start of the New Year.
Italy stretches from the Alps to Africa and differences regarding the weather can be huge. Summers are generally warm everywhere, except high up in the mountains. Temperatures average 30 °C or more in large parts of the country from June to September with the highest temperatures recorded in the south, sometimes over 45 °C. Nights are warm, around or even above 20 °C, lower though in the northern parts. In the north, winters can be very cold and snowfall is common in the mountains. The central parts along the coast are mild this time of year, between 10 °C and 15 °C during the day and above 0 °C at night. In the south, days of over 20 °C are possible even in winter though nights can be chilly. Winters in the north can be bitterly cold, even during the day and especially high up in the mountains where metres of snow can fall and temperatures can drop below -20 °C.
One of the most convenient ways to get to Italy is by plane. The two airports with flights to and from North America and Asia are Rome Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport (FCO) in Rome and Malpensa International Airport (MXP) in Milan. These airports are served by almost all major international airlines and European airlines. Milan Linate Airport has flights to Milan as well and Orio al Serio Airport near Bergamo (45 kilometres from Milan) is one of the biggest budget airline airport in the country. Rome Ciampino Airport provides the same function for the capital.
The cities of Venice (Venice Marco Polo Airport and Venice Treviso Airport), Bologna (Bologna Airport), Verona, Turin (Turin Caselle Airport), Florence and Naples (Naples Airport) have good airports with flights to most major European and Italian cities. The national airline is Alitalia.
Meridiana is one of several lowcost airlines and has hubs in Florence and Verona its base at Venice Marco Polo Airport. It flies to major cities in Europe, like Paris, London and Amsterdam among other cities. Ryanair, as usual uses a couple out of the way airports, like Pisa Galileo Galilei Airport, Venice Treviso Airport, Bergamo Orio al Serio Airport and Olbia, although out of the way, connections in general are pretty good. Other budget airlines with flights to mainly European destinations are My Air and Volare Airlines.
The main islands of Sardinia and Sicily both have quite a few direct connections from places throughout Europe. One of the biggest is Catania-Fontanarossa Airport in the west of Sicily, although also Palermo Airport receives a significant number of flights from places throughout Europe. The largest one on Sardinia is the Cagliari-Elmas Airport, although Alghero Airport and Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport have flights as well.
From France, Italy can be reached by the EC train via the coast (Nice - Ventimiglia - Genoa) or by TGV via the Fréjus tunnel (Chambéry - Bardonecchia - Turin). From Switzerland, there are frequent EC trains between Basel and Milan, calling at Chiasso. From Austria, there are nightly and daily trains between Vienna and Venice, calling at the border town of Villach. Between Italy and Slovenia, there is a connection in the north at Nova Gorica/Gorizia, and one in the south near Sežana, on the route of the Euronight train between Budapest and Venice.
International tickets can be booked through Trenitalia or one of the other national carriers involved, or via a travel agency. Note that the online payment facility of the Trenitalia website is known to cause frequent problems when used with non-Italian credit cards. For more information, see the international trains article.
From France, Italy can be reached by A5 via the Mont Blanc tunnel, by A32 via the Fréjus tunnel, and by A10 via Nice. From Switzerland, there is A9 via Chiasso. From Austria, the A22 enters Italy via Brennero, and A23 in the east near Tarvisio. From Slovenia, there are no highways into Italy, but there are several provincial routes that you can take.
If you want to go by bus, Eurolines has direct connections to various destinations in Italy. Milan serves as a major hub in their network with lots of connections to both western and eastern Europe.
Italy being a peninsula, there are many possible entry points for those wanting to arrive by water. For bookings on most ferries, you can use Ferriesonline or Viamare. Off-season, you can get much better deals just showing up at the harbour, although this typically requires some flexibility in your travel plans, as many routes don't have daily service.
Italy can be reached across the Adriatic from Croatia, Slovenia and Montenegro. Across the Ionean Sea lie Greece, Albania and Malta (no direct connections with Turkey exist). Across the Mediterranean proper lie Spain, France, Tunisia and Morocco (no direct connections exist with Libya, Egypt and Algeria, nor with Israel, Lebanon and Syria).
Of course you can fly around Italy, but why should you? It is quite expensive, and most local airfields are difficult to reach without a car. Basically, flying is only a feasible means of transport if you want to get from northern Italy (Milan or further up north) to the region south of Naples, including Sicily. On all other itineraries, the train will be about as fast and much cheaper.
Short of driving a car, going by train is the best way to explore Italy. The Italian railroad network is amazingly widespread, and even remote areas in central and southern Italy have several connections daily to the outside world. On a downside, Italy's national railway carrier Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), is the country's finest example of mismanagement and bureaucracy in state-owned companies, and is excruciatingly slow and inefficient, especially to the 'western' eye. Still, service is cheap, and with a bit of patience and perseverance, gets you everywhere. Just allow for plenty (really, plenty: 4-6 hours is not exaggerated) of extra time when you need to make some kind of deadline.
FS operates the following train types on national connections:
A map of the Italian railroad network can be downloaded here. Booking and buying tickets can be done at the counter at any FS station, or at ticket machines on larger stations. Personnel operating the counters can be slow and, outside major tourist destinations, not proficient in English, but is usually friendly and patient. Best pay with cash, since foreign debit and credit cards are known to slow down the purchasing even further. Try to avoid the international counters at Roma Termini station; going to another station, for instance Roma Tiburtina, will save you time. Don't bother trying to book tickets over the internet: although the FS website offers that facility, it does not work with foreign accounts.
If you want to go to out-of-the-way places, exploring Italy by car is your best option. The roads are of good overall quality, ranging from outstanding in the north to average in central Italy, to acceptable in the south and on the islands (Sicily and Sardinia). In the deep south, expect to encounter a lot of potholes and very few gas stations off the highway (E45/A3 south of Salerno; E55/A14 south of Foggia). If you bring a vehicle running on LPG instead of petrol or diesel, consult your local AAA beforehand, since availability tends to be seasonal.
The Italians drive assertively, but nothing as crazy as countryside Portugal or South America. Their main issues appear to be the observance of speed limits and lending priority. You need to be over 18 and in the possession of an international driver's licence in order to operate a vehicle. The use of seatbelts is compulsory, as is using your headlights on all highways. Using a cell phone is forbidden while driving. The usual European traffic rules apply. Watch out for cyclists, who can use all roads except national highways. Needless to say, Italy has right-side driving.
Rentals are widely available, mostly at airports but also in downtown areas. In addition to a valid ID, international driver's license and a credit card, a collision damage waiver and theft protection are mandatory when renting a vehicle; check with your travel insurance in advance. Additional protection in case of accidents etc. can usually be purchased locally. Most agencies, including those that operate internationally, do not allow you to cross the border with your rental; drop-off in other cities is usually possible. Easyterra offers a decent comparison between companies, although booking directly is obviously cheaper. During European school holidays, best book in advance, especially for pick-up locations in the triangle Turin - Venice - Rome.
In the unlikely event you want to go where trains can't take you, there's always the option of going by bus. Buses in Italy roughly come in two types: suburban transportation under the supervision of local government, and regional transportation under supervision of regional and/or provincial authorities. The frequency of service can vary tremendously according to region and season, but you can generally count on each route being serviced 3 or 4 times a day. In addition, Eurolines operates a number of long-distance services in Italy.
Bus terminals tend to be located in the outskirts of large cities, or near train stations. The main bus terminal of Rome is Anagnina, which can be reached by subway.
Except when visiting Sicily, Sardinia or one of the smaller islands, taking a ferry is not a feasible way to save time or money. Ferries are an excellent option for international travel, though; more information is given above. The main Mediterranean ports in Italy are Civitavecchia near Rome, and Genoa; the main Adriatic ports are Ancona and Brindisi. Possible ferries to take include Moby Lines andGrimaldi Lines. There are also numerous ferries that ply the routes to smaller islands off the coast of mainland Italy, like Elba and Capri. It is beyond the scope of this article to mention all of them but a good idea of the possibilities can be found on this ferry website.
If you are a European Union (EU) citizen, you may enter without any restriction as per your EU citizenship rights. If you are not an EU citizen, you might need to obtain a Schengen Visa. This visa is valid for any country in the Schengen zone.
Italy has adopted the Euro (ISO code: EUR, symbol: €) as its official currency. One Euro is divided into 100 cents, which is sometimes referred to as eurocents, especially when distinguishing them with the US cents.
Euro banknotes come in denominations of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, €500. The highest three denominations are rarely used in everyday transactions. All Euro banknotes have a common design for each denomination on both sides throughout the Eurozone.
The Euro coins are 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, €1 and €2. Some countries in the Eurozone have law which requires cash transactions to be rounded to the nearest 5 cents. All Euro coins have a common design on the denomination (value) side, while the opposite side may have a different image from one country to another.  Although the image side may be different, all Euro coins remain legal tender throughout the Eurozone. The image for the Italy coin is the Colosseum in Rome.
Work in Italy is not easy to find. Many young adults, especially women, are without a job. There's a huge underground black market though, where you'll find many people working not being book-regulated. Most "black" workers can be found in small business such as bars, pubs and small shops, or as construction workers. Although this kind of job is illegal (but legal consequences are most on the employer) they're probably the easier thing to find if you're looking for a temporary job.
For English-speakers looking to study in Italy, there are several options. In Rome, Duquesne University, John Cabot, Loyola University Chicago and Temple University maintain campuses. Right outside of Rome the University of Dallas maintains its own campus in Marino. St. John's University has a graduate program in Rome for International Relations and MBA. New York University has a study-abroad program in Florence available even to freshmen and maintains its own campus at Villa La Pietra.
The official Italian language, although closer to its predecessor than any of its Romance relatives, was not codified until 1860 when Alessandro Manzoni wrote I promessi sposi, which is generally recognised as the birth of modern Italian. However, as is often the case with national languages, its use remained restricted to the area of politics and public government for most of its existence, while peple continued to use their local, provincial and regional dialects instead. Only in the last 40 years has standard Italian begun to be a significant influence in culture, news and literature.
Grammatically, Italian strongly resembles the Tuscan dialect, while phonetically, it is much closer to varieties spoken around Padua. Foreigners generally appreciate the clear sound and transparent grammar, although either may pose problems depending on one's own language background. Two areas of Italian syntax that are notorious for causing problems for non-native speakers are the correct inflection and use of the many verbal tenses (the regular verbal paradigm of Italian comprises well over a 100 forms per stem), and the use of impersonal pronouns. In pronunciation, many have trouble dealing with consonant gemination (Italian does not distinguish long and short vowels, but long and short consonants instead) and the various affricate sounds (ts, dz, tch, tsj dzj).
For a long time, English proficiency among Italians has been very poor. This has improved rapidly over the past 15 years, to the extent that at most tourist destinations, you can now get by in English. Outside touristy regions, esp. south of Naples, proficiency is much less, and some knowledge of Italian will be useful. Speakers of French and Spanish should have  fewer problems being understood, given the amount of similarity between their languages and Italian. To the north, esp. in Trentino-Alto Adige, you can get by on German. In Istria, Slovene is widely spoken. Any attempt by foreigners to express themselves in Italian is much appreciated.
Italian language classes for foreign travellers are offered by universities and private institutes alike. Perugia is the city with the largest offer, and its institutes are generally considered the best in Italy. But the universities of Rome and Florence also offer special courses for foreigners.
Some would argue that the main reason to visit Italy is because of the amazing food! Fashion, famous sights, churches, art and beautiful people come second in many peoples perspective when it comes to the great food of Italy. Italy is known for having great food and food items such as pastas, cheeses, dried meats, breads, beef and sea food.  Although the food changes from region to region all of it is amazing. Of course next to the dozens of pasta varietes and the best pizza in the world, famous dishes include risotto, polenta and arancini. And Italians adore their icecream (gelato) and sweet deserts like tiramisu. And don't forget to drink the right wine for the right meal!
From five-star resorts to staying in converted medieval monastery to sleeping in a backpacker dorm: there is something for everyone in Italy. Although most people stay in pretty regular hotels or youth hostels there are plenty of interesting options scattered across the country. Even in major cities a traveller can still find good priced housing in many of a converted mansion, monastery, factory or garrison. In recent years the cost of lodging has gone up because of the strengthening of the euro.
The beverage most commonly associated with Italy is definitely coffee. If you love coffee, Italy is the place to be. You'll find good coffee almost everywhere, but follow the locals to the best joints. Expect to pay about €1 for an espresso, and around €1.40 for a cappuccino. Simply asking for a coffee will generally get you an espresso (especially if your barista is in a bad mood), so be specific. Also, if you ask for a latte as opposed to a caffe latte, expect a plain old glass of milk.
Wine is the drink of choice in Italy. From the north to the south of the peninsula there are some fantastic wineries to found. One of the best parts of travelling in Italy is enjoying the different local wines in different parts of the country that are impossible to find anywhere else in the world. Also local wine shops in some towns have amazing deals on wine that will blow your palate. It is far beyond the scope of this guide to minutely examine the different styles of wine in Italy, but here's a quick idea of some of the most commonly known varieties:
Often the most economical way to buy wine in restaurants is to order vino della casa (house wine), which can usually be ordered by the litre, half (mezza) or quarter (quatro) litre. It's not going to win any awards but if you are travelling on a budget, it can be a very good way to go.
There are no vaccinations legally required to travel to Italy. It is recommended to have a vaccination against tick borne encephalitis when you go hiking and/or camping for 4 weeks or more in the period of March to November, but only in the north of the country.
In general, Italy is a safe countries for travellers and if you take the normal precaution you won't face too many problems in the country. Take care of yourself and your belongings, especially in bigger cities, markets and big transportation centers like railway stations and bus stations.
Famous for the Mafia, especially in the southern part of the country (think Naples and Sicily), you won't be bothered by them at all. They have other problems and things to worry about.
Some parts can be extremely hot in summer so drink plenty of fluids. Other parts get cold and snowy in winter, especially in the Alps and Dolomites in the north. And there is a chance of avalanches in the mountains from December up till May.
Another potential hazzard are earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, especially in the central and southern part of the country. Again, chances that travellers are injured are slim.
Almost all towns and cities in Italy have internet cafes. A growing number of budget hostels and nicer hotels have free Wifi. By law all public-access internet points must keep records of web sites viewed by customers, and even the customer's ID: expect to be refused access if you don't provide identification. Hotels providing Internet access are not required to record IDs if the connection is provided in the guest's room, although if the connection is offered in the main public hall then IDs are required. Publicly available wireless access without user identification is illegal, so open Wi-Fi hotspots (like the ones you might expect to find in a mall or cafée) all have some form of (generally one-time) registration.
The main networks are TIM (Telecom Italia Mobile, part of Telecom Italia, formerly state controlled), Vodafone, Wind, and 3 (only UMTS cellphones). Best advice is to buy a prepaid SIM card (from € 10 upwards) and a cheap mobile phone (€ 19 upwards) to put it in (if you don't have a cellphone already that you can use). It will be much more practical. All land line numbers start with 0. Mobile numbers start with 3. Numbers starting with 89 are high-fee services. In case of emergency call the appropriate number from the list below. Such calls are usually free and calls to 112, 113 (police), 115 (fire), 118 (health) can be made from payphones for free without the need of inserting coins. 112 (standard emergency number in GSM specification) can be dialed in any case for free from any mobile phone.
Post Italiane is the national postal services of Italy and has quite an efficient network of postal offices and reliable postal services. Standard letters and postcards (up to 20 grams) cost €0.39 to send within Europe and the Mediterranean countries outside Europe and €0.41 to all other destinations throughout the country. Up to 50 grams, prices start at €0.52 for Europe, €0.62 for other areas. Packages start at €1.55 within Europe, and around €2.50 for other countries. Post office business hours in Italy are from 8:30am to 2:00pm from Monday to Friday, with closing times at Saturday and the last day of the month at 12 noon. In general, larger post offices in bigger cities and in tourist areas keep longer hours than those in local towns. Also note that business hours in the south might be different than the north, with longer hours at night, especially in summer! If you want to send packages you might try faster and more reliable/efficient private courier companies like TNT, UPS or DHL.

### France ###

Sure, it's a cliché, but there is a reason why a visit to France is a must if you're planning to do a European tour. In the political sphere, France remains a major world power but let's forget about politics - French food is where the heart of interests lies! It's not about the fries (which is Belgian to start with), but of excellent meals accompanied by excellent wines at excellent prices and you're starting to get the picture. Compound that with amazing architecture, breathtaking natural landscape, and varying regional customs and traditions, a trip to France makes a truly memorable journey.
France is one of the western world's most important centres of cultured folks: names like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Hector Berlioz, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, Victor Hugo and Claude Monet are but a handful of the many world-renowned composers, writers and artists that France has produced. It is little wonder the French are so proud of their culture, and sensational monuments such as the Eiffel Tower only emphasize French pride. But proud or not, you will be inclined to agree with the locals after exploring France's unlimited possibilities.
Of course, the capital Paris is travellers' favourite destination, particularly for a first-timer in France. Nonetheless, it pays to check out some other regions of the country too, such as Bretagne (Brittany) in the north and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in the south.
The early traces of human life in France date back by tens of thousands of year, as evident through archaeological finds including the Lascaux cave paintings and the stone alignments of Carnac. Known as Gaul, it came under Roman power, initially annexed in the southern part of the country and eventually under the lead of Julius Caesar, Gaul fell into Roman hands. The Celtic culture was gradually displaced by Gallo-Roman culture. However, by the 3rd century AD, the Goths and later the Huns asserted their presence. After the fall of the Roman Empire the Franks moved in and settled throughout Gaul. The collapse of the Roman Empire marked the start of a period of instability and invasions in Gaul. Both the Frankish dynasties of the Merovingians (486-751) and the Carolingians (751-987) ruled the country for over 500 years, but failed to bring stability, leaving the country divided into smaller kingdoms.
By the 12th century, the monarchy was becoming increasingly dominant. During the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) between England and France, the country was devastated from war damages, frequent famines and ravaging plagues. The renewal of power in France was soon followed with the invasion of Italy, and in this period, the ideals of Italian Renaissance spread to France. This marked the beginning of early modern France. France was embroiled in war once again, this time over religion. When the turmoil eventually subsided, the country entered a new period of exceptional power and influence, with the King having absolute power.
A period of stability enabled intellectual engagements in France, drawing it into the era of Enlightenment. Philosophers, through their ideas, challenged the aristocratic power that was increasingly unpopular for the excessive spending by the royals and decadent living in Versailles while the rest of the country struggled through financial hardship. It eventually triggered the French Revolution in 1789, culminating in the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette.
The period of transition and self-rule did not last long. In 1799, Napoleon staged a coup and declared himself Emperor Napoleon I. He extended his empire by going to war with other countries, conquering most of western Europe. The invasion of Russia however became his downfall war and for a short period the French monarchy was restored. The restored monarchy was relatively short-lived as a Napoleonic clan mounted their comeback in 1848 and Napoleon's nephew came to power. He subsequently crowned himself as emperor and named himself Napoleon III. His reign ended with the French-German war of 1870-1871 in which France lost the Alsace region to Prussia.
In the decade before World War I, the Belle Époque (Beautiful Era) took place and pushed forward a new height in cultural innovations and artistic transformations. The movement of Art Nouveau reached its peak in this period. France was drawn into World War I, when Germany invaded the country in an attempt to get access to the north sea. The trench war lasted until 1918 in mainly the north of France, and Belgium. During World War II, France was partly occupied by Germany and partly under the regime of the collaborating regime of Vichy France. France was finally liberated with help by allied forces in 1944, which started the liberation on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.
After the war France was one of the founding members of European Economic Community (EEC) which eventually evolved into the European Union (EU), it introduced the Euro in 2002.
France, nicknamed l'Hexagone for its hexagonal shape, shares international borders with Spain, Andorra, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium. There is also a train link with England via an underwater tunnel called the Channel Tunnel, or the "Chunnel". France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N (Dunkirk is just north of 51°), and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. The European territory of France covers 547,030 square kilometres, having the largest area among European Union members. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest.
France is geographically diverse, with large parts of the country being gently rolling green pastures but there are rougher areas as well, including mountain ranges of Pyrénées in the south on the border with Spain and Andorra, The Alps on the border with Switzerland and Italy in the east and smaller mountain ranges like the Vosges and Massif Central. In the south and southeast there are rugged areas with cliffs, rocks and steep and deep gorges, for example the ones near Verdun. The main rivers in France are the Garonne, Loire, Seine and Rhône. At 4,810 metres above sea level, the highest point in Western Europe, Mont Blanc, is situated in the Alps on the border between France and Italy. France also has extensive river systems such as the Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, and the Rhône, which divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast.
While Metropolitan France is located in Western Europe, the French Republic also has a number of territories in North America, the Caribbean, South America, the southern Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and Antarctica. These territories have varying forms of government ranging from overseas department to overseas collectivity. France's overseas departments and collectivities share land borders with Brazil, and Suriname (bordering French Guiana), and Sint Maarten (bordering Saint Martin).
For the purpose of this guide, the information to follow pertains to Metropolitan France. For details of the overseas regions, please refer to the relevant article links above.
France is divided into 13 regions in mainland France, including Corsica. In addition there are 5 overseas departments and 7 overseas territories.
The Avenue des Champs-Élysées, or just Champs-Élysées, is the most prestigious road in Paris. It is one of the most famous roads in the world and also one of the world most expensive ones regarding the renting and buying of real estate. The name is French for Elysian Fields, the place of the blessed dead in Greek mythology, and is sometimes voted as one of the most beautiful avenues in the world. The road is lined with luxury shops, restaurants, small cafés and other interesting places. The avenue is about 2 kilometers long and goes through the 8th arrondissement in the northwest of Paris, running from the Place de la Concorde in the east, with the Obelisk of Luxor, to the Place Charles de Gaulle in the west, the location of the Arc de Triomphe. The Champs-Élysées forms part of the Axe historique and since 1975 also is the traditional finish place of the last stage of the Tour de France.
There is nowhere to observe Gothic architecture at its best but where it originated, and dominated from the 12th to 16th century. Originally known as Opus Francigenum (the French Style), it is associated with many great cathedrals and basilicas in Northern France. Cathedral Notre-Dame de Chartres© BeausoleilSome that are most revered include Notre-Dame de Paris, Notre-Dame de Chartres, Notre-Dame d'Amiens, Notre-Dame de Reims, Notre-Dame de Laon, Saint-Pierre de Beauvais and Basilique Saint-Denis. Basilique Saint-Denis is also unique, in that it was built in transitional style between Gothic architecture and its predecessor, Romanesque architecture.
Along the valley of the Loire, extending from Centre to western France towards the Atlantic, are hundreds of magnificent châteaux and fortresses. Today, many of these châteaux are private residences, some are hotels and guest houses, while a handful are owned and managed by the (local) government authority as major tourist sites. Among the best known worldwide are Château de Villandry, Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, Château de Chenonceau, Château de Chambord and Château d'Amboise. The valley from Sully-sur-Loire, in the Loiret, to Chalonnes-sur-Loire, in Maine-et-Loire is now classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
A calanque refers to deep and steep limestone valley that is partly submerged by the sea. Les Calanques that stretch from Marseille to Cassis form an amazing rugged coastline with the valleys offering great hiking and rock climbing opportunities. The coastline can be toured as a half-day trip, usually with a stopover at Château d'If (of the famed Count de Monte Cristo) on the way back towards Marseille. The walls of the spectacular Cave Cosquer in the Calanque de Morgiou are covered with prehistoric paintings and engravings. The underwater access to this grotto is completley forbidden.
Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the Alps, and sometimes mistakenly named as the highest mountain in Europe (which is the Elbrus). It is the highest mountain of the Mont Blanc Massif, which is popular for mountaineering, skiing, snowboarding and hiking. Other outdoor activities on offer include glacier hiking, ice climbing, paragliding, canyoning and mountain-biking. From Chamonix, a spectacular cable car transports its visitor up to the Aiguille du Midi.
While Gothic architecture remains prevalent in Northern France, scattered all over the country are medieval Romanesque abbeys and churches, no less interesting in their own rights. Mont Saint-Michel, Saint-Etienne de Caen, Saint-Front de Périgueux, Abbaye de Fontenay, Saint-Sernin de Toulouse, Saint-Pierre de Moissac and Sainte-Madeleine de Vézelay are but some of them. The Romanesque period flourished between 10th to 12th century.
The Palace of Versailles is a royal castle in Versailles. When the château was built, Versailles was a small village, today it is a suburb of Paris, 20 kilometres southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved to Versailles from Paris, until late 1789 when the royal family was forced to return to Paris after the beginning of the French Revolution. Today it is one of the biggest tourist attractions in France, and a popular day trip from Paris. The castle itself houses 2,300 rooms, and the gardens cover a huge area on the west side of the palace, and is largely unchanged for the last 300 years when it was designed. The palace and gardens are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
As France stretches from Belgium in the north to Spain in the south, the weather also differs accordingly. The north and parts of the west have a maritime climate with mild winters and cool to warm summers. During winter, it is mostly above 0 °C with some frost at night possible. Summer temperatures are between 20 °C and 25 °C. Temperatures close to 40 °C have been previously recorded, but this is rare. The central parts of France are warmer in summer, but colder in winters, and The Alps are a favorite ski resort area during the months of December to March when snow is almost certain.
Further south, the climate becomes Mediterranean with warm summers, around 30 °C, even a bit more inland, and generally mild winters, between 10 °C and 15 °C. That said, even this warm coastline has some frost and snow, especially in the western part of the Mediterranean coastline, for example near Marseille. Further east, around Nice, frost and snow are less common. This also applies to Corsica, where warm summers and mild winters are the norm and frost is uncommon, though even here, a few degrees below 0 °C at sea level has been recorded in the past. The southwest of France is a bit cooler in summer, and comparable in winter.
Precipitation is possible in all months, though spring is one of the driest periods of the year. Many higher areas have snow in winter, while parts of France can be very dry for months in the summer season of May to October. The west and northwest are probably the wettest parts of the country, especially in Brittany and Normandy during the winter months.
If you're travelling from outside Europe, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris will most likely be your point of entry. There are other international airports in Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Nice and Toulouse, which serve flights to destinations throughout Europe. Paris' second major airport, Paris Orly Airport (ORY), also has flights to European destinations. Paris Beauvais-Tillé Airport (BVA) and Marseille MP2 (MRS) are hubs for budget airlines like Ryanair. There are quite a few more international airports in the country, for example:
Air France is a major airline and part of the SkyTeam Alliance. In 2003, it merged with Dutch airline KLM. Air France operates flights to hundreds of destinations around the world.
There are many possibilities of travelling from neighbouring countries to France. Listed below are several options of direct cross-border train routes, with Paris as the hub. Note that many more long distance options are available, either directly or via a combination of train connections, from Paris and other cities in France.
Many very good toll roads lead out of and into the country, with good connections to Luxembourg, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Monaco and Switzerland. Be sure to have your personal documentation and that of the car in order, like insurance and driving permit. Driving in France, like its neighbouring countries in continental Europe, is on the right hand side of the road. Travel by car to/fro UK and Ireland is also possible, with either a connection using ferries or by crossing the Channel Tunnel on a train (possible for England, Scotland and Wales).
There are a couple of main options to travel by bus between France and other countries.
It is possible to catch the ferry across the English Channel from the United Kingdom and Ireland. There are also boats travelling to and from Spain, Italy and countries in Northern Africa.
Air France is the main carrier which has domestic flights to many cities in the country. Most flights originate or terminate at one of the two airports in Paris:
The only internal flight served at the Beauvais-Tillé Airport(BVA) is the service between Paris and Marseille by Ryanair. Ryanair however also operates a number of other domestic routes from Marseille MP2 Airport (MRS), namely to Biarritz, Brest, Lille, Nantes and Tours. A better budget airline with more domestic flight options is Easyjet. It operates on the following routes: Paris-Biarritz, Paris-Corsica, Paris-Nice, Paris-Toulouse, Lyon-Biarritz, Lyon-Bordeaux, Lyon-Corsica, Lyon-Nantes and Lyon-Toulouse.
It is also often possible to fly directly from a major French city to another (for example Nantes to Bordeaux) without going through Paris.
The French Railways, SNCF has an extensive network with frequent, fast and comfortable connections to almost any of the major towns and cities in France. The main hub for the rail network is Paris.
Train tickets may be purchased 3 months ahead of travel, from either Voyages-SNCF (in French) or TGV-Europe (English and other European languages) and the tickets will be delivered to the country of order accordingly. However, online purchase and reservation for TER is not possible. Tickets for iDTGV are available 6 months ahead of travel.
There are also sleeping cars with the option of taking your own car that run from the north (Calais) to the southern coastline.
Travelling around by car in France is safe, fast and economical when travelling with at least two persons. There are many international and local companies to choose from for car hire at most airports and cities. A national driver's licence is required and you need to be at least 21 years old, although some might require you to be 25. The main highways are all toll roads and well maintained. Although slower, the routes nationales are much more beautiful and you don't have to pay toll.
There is no single bus operator in France, and intercity buses are rather limited as the train network is pretty extensive and getting around by car is much more popular. Check Eurolines for some connections, especially from north to south.
Within local departments though, there are usually bus operators that connect between the cities/towns/villages, such as TAM (Transport Alpes-Maritimes) which connects the towns in eastern French Riviera between Nice and Menton. Larger cities will also normally boast a relatively comprehensive bus network, such as the bus services run by RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens) in Paris and its environs. In many rural areas, the SNCF (French railways) run regional bus services where there is no railway; but don't expect cut price travel. SNCF bus services are priced at the same rate as trains.
The Société Nationale Maritime Corse-Mediterranée has a number of daily services between mainland France and the islands of the coast, most notably Corsica. Services run from Marseille, Toulon and Nice to Ajaccio, Propriano, Porto Vecchio and Bastia on Corsica. In the west, SMN Navigation offers ferries between the mainland and the islands off the coast west of Brittany.
Apart from these regular public ferries, there are loads of option of getting around one of the many rivers in France. But usually this involves renting a yacht or joining a cruise or other sort of tour. The main rivers include the Rhone, Garonne, Saone, Seine and the Loire. Canal transportations are also available in relevant cities (e.g. Canal-Saint-Martin in Paris).
If you are a European Union (EU) citizen, you are in luck. You may travel without any restriction as per your EU citizenship rights. If you are not an EU citizen and France is the first stop on your visit, you will need to obtain a Schengen Visa. This visa is usually valid for any country in the Schengen zone. See the French Governmental website for more (official) information on French visa and immigration policy.
France has adopted the Euro (ISO code: EUR, symbol: €) as its official currency. One Euro is divided into 100 cents, which is sometimes referred to as eurocents, especially when distinguishing them with the US cents.
Euro banknotes come in denominations of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, €500. The highest three denominations are rarely used in everyday transactions. All Euro banknotes have a common design for each denomination on both sides throughout the Eurozone.
The Euro coins are 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, €1 and €2. Some countries in the Eurozone have law which requires cash transactions to be rounded to the nearest 5 cents. All Euro coins have a common design on the denomination (value) side, while the opposite side may have a different image from one country to another. Although the image side may be different, all Euro coins remain legal tender throughout the Eurozone.
Citizens of EU and EEA countries (save from some Eastern European countries, for a temporary period) and Switzerland can work in France without having to secure a work permit. Most non-EU citizens will need a work permit - however, some non-EU citizens (such as Canadians, Croatians, New Zealanders etc.) do not require a visa or work permit to work during their 90 day visa-free period of stay in France.
There are plenty of opportunities for studying in France, either to learn the language, or to spend a semester or year in France under one of the various international student mobility schemes, such as Erasmus or ISEP. Students wishing to enrol in a French university to follow a full course should contact the French Embassy in their country, if outside the European Union, or contact the university directly if they are EU citizens. The Study in France website has details on the opportunities available, and how to choose where to study in France.
French is the official language of the country, and by far is the most widely spoken in France despite the varying regional accents which may confuse non-native speakers into wondering if a regional dialect is being spoken. The use of French is governed by the Académie Française, which is the official authority on the usage, vocabulary and the grammar of the French language. However, their recommendations do not carry legal power and remain just that, recommendations. Some other languages used in France include Breton, Basque, Catalan, Alsatian and Corsican.
The teaching of a second and/or a third language is common nowadays, and English is the most commonly studied foreign language in French schools. Other languages often taught include Spanish, Italian and German. The immigrant populations also speak languages from their countries of origin, including Arabic, Mandarin, Russian and Vietnamese.
The most commonly used form of argot (slang) is verlan, which features inversion of syllables in a word. The word verlan itself originated from l'envers, which in French means "the reverse". Verlan in general is not obvious nor easily understood by non-native speakers.
La Gastronomie is as much a passion as a past-time in France. Each region has developed its own unique dishes and flavors through hundreds of years of tradition. Even today, the concept of eating main meals in courses is still used on a daily basis. In larger city restaurants, it is common to find different 'menus' that will include a bread course, one or two main dishes and a choice of a cheese course or dessert for under €20. To decide where to eat, the french consult the world-renowned Michelin Guide. This is the most used and prestigious restaurant guide, using a system of stars to rate establishments.The french eat their main meal of the day at noon, followed by a lighter dinner later in the evening. In smaller cities especially, many businesses will close for lunch (usually between 12 noon and 2:00pm). This supports the culture that lunch is to be shared with friends and family. Four o' clock in the after noon is a widely recognized time to eat a small snack. This practice is known as to faire quatre-heures. French food and eating traditions have been established over centuries. Today many aspects of this gastronomic culture still remain, but the growing influence of western culture is evident. More and more busy families are choosing quicker and simpler meals during the week. Even though France refused to bend to fast food chains in the past, today McDonald's is gaining in popularity, especially with the younger generation.
France has a wide selection of accommodation, from budget campings and hostels up to luxurious 5-star+ hotels, mainly along the Cote d'Azur and in the bigger cities like Paris. But there are also some more intimate options like Chambre d'Hôtes and options to rent homes as a family, called Gîtes. Some very romantic options include castles (Chateaux) which mainly stand in the rural areas and give you the option to rent either a room or, in some cases, the whole castle! In winter, renting a chalet in the French Alps is a great way to enjoy the mountainous scenery and go skiing. It also works out cheaper if you are with a group compared to a hotel room.
France is a popular country among people who like to go camping, either with a tent or with a caravan. There are tens of thousands of camping grounds around the country, which are popular from April/May until September or October. Note that some popular areas, mainly near the coast, can be fully booked during the main holiday season in July and, especially, August when the French people themselves have holidays.
Throughout the country, there are some very special sleeping options, called Chambres d'Hôtes and Gîtes. Chambre d'Hôtes are the French version of Bed&Breakfast with rooms available within the homes of people and include breakfast. The latter are holiday homes which are available for rent and usually come fully furnished and equipped for self-catering.
Gîtes are not part of the house where the owner lives, but are free-standing homes, sometimes quite far away, and usually don't include breakfast or any other meal. For an idea of the options throughout the country, check the Chambres d'Hôtes and Gîtes websites for locations and prices.
No vaccinations are required before entering France and few general diseases occur in the country. The health system in France is good, with both public and private hospitals and good care. It is recommended to have a vaccination against tick borne encephalitis when you go hiking and/or camping for 4 weeks or more in the period of March to November. This only applies to forested areas in the northeastern part of the country, especially around Metz, Nancy, Mulhouse and Strasbourg.
All in all, France is one of the safest countries to travel around anywhere in the world. The general precautions apply of course, especially if related to the bigger cities. Don't flash your wealth around and keep jewelry at home. Try not to walk around in unlit or deserted streets in cities and if you can, travel by taxi at night to go to suburban areas. Violent crime is relatively rare in France. However, the crime rate has increased a little, requiring travelers to take responsible action in ensuring their security. It is simple a matter of staying alert as to what situations are best avoided. Some basic rules which are good to know include the following:
France is one of the best connected countries in the world, with data speed for upload/download ranked among the top 5 in the world. Most hotels and hostels would have in-house facilities to provide free internet access. Many major cities also have initiatives put in place to provide free wi-fi connection in public spaces. Alternatively there are internet cafés available in most cities/towns at a reasonable rate. Some private businesses, such as local cafés (or even the Starbuck's chain), may also provide wi-fi connectivity - keep an eye out for the signs by the shop windows/doors. Also look for the @ symbol prominently displayed, which indicates internet availability. However, with most homes now wired for the internet, cyber cafés are increasingly hard to find, especially outside the major cities.
To dial an international number from France, the IDD is 00, followed by the country code that you wish to dial, the area code and the phone number.To call France from abroad, start with the international direct dialing (IDD) code from the country you're in, followed by French country code 33, the area code (drop the first zero in front of the area code), and the phone number. French telephone numbers are rarely given without the area code. The telephone number, including the area code, is made up of 10 digits. They are written in a set of 5 pairs of digits (i.e. 01 xx xx xx xx xx). In France, the area code designations are: 01 - Paris Area ("Région Ile-de-France"), 02 - northwest, 03 - northeast, 04 - southeast, 05 - southwest, 06 - mobile phone providers. From 2010 onwards, 07 will also be assigned to mobile phone providers in order to cater for the surging demands for mobile phones.
Emergency numbers are 15 (medical aid), 17 (police station) and 18 (fire/rescue). You can also use the European emergency number 112 (perhaps a better choice if you don't speak French). These calls are free and accessible from virtually any phone, including locked cellphones.
France uses the GSM standard of cellular phones (900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands) used in most of the world outside of the U.S. There are several companies (Orange, SFR, Free, Bouygues Télécom and some others MVNOs like Virgin Mobile) offering wireless service. The country is almost totally covered but you may have difficulties using your mobile phone in rural or mountainous areas. If you stay for some time, it may be advisable to buy a pre-paid cell phone card that you can use in any phone that supports the GSM standard on the 900/1800 MHz bands. Then incoming calls and SMSes are free.
La Poste in France is also referred to as the PTT (short for postes, télégraphes et téléphones). The mailboxes are painted bright yellow and often there is a slot for local city mail and another slot for "outside mail". Normally there is a queue in the post office, but most of the post offices have the self service machine installed which is quite easy to operate. Nowadays many of the tabac and even some of the souvenir shops also sell postage stamps. Normally an overseas postcard costs almost as much as sending a letter. Mails sent in France also have a zip code. The first two numbers represent the administrative department (e.g. in Paris' case that would be 75).
Post offices are generally open from 8:00am to 7:00pm Monday through Friday, and 8:00am to noon on Saturdays. Apart from the basic job of mailing letters, most of the post offices do some banking activities also and some even have photocopy machines and cyber cafes for internet access.
For international package services, you might also check options with companies like DHL, UPS or TNT, which have competitive services and prices and might be faster in most cases.

I've traveled extensively in France over the past 20+ years including Paris and much of rural France. We typically spend a week in a gite doing day trips in the area. We've stayed in most areas of the country including Alsace, Provence (PACA), Burgundy, Normandy, Bretagne, Languedoc-Roussillon, Centre, Midi-Pyrenees, the Loire and the Dordogne, etc.
I had extensive Travel Pages on Virtual Tourist (now off line) on France and was a top poster for both Paris and the rest of the country.
Campsites along the Med.How to avoid being killed by French drivers.
I live in Languedoc, and am fairly clued up on most areas of France.
I have been living abroad for many years and moved back to France recently. I miss the international connection and I really appreciated the warm welcome I received abroad. If some of you are planning to visit France, I would be happy to help you with suggestions an maybe meet for a drink or something. I am 43 currently living Bretagne west of France but I have lived in many places in France. I am lecturing at the University if that's of interest. Feel free to contact me here or via email -snip-
...have lived in France for twenty years, mostly in Aquitaine but have moved around...may be able to help, you won't know 'til you ask...
